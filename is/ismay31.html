<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Journal of Isaac Sharp - May 31, 1862</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Breakfasted at seven, and left Famien(Fmjin)about 8.20, with four baggage-bearers, who mounted the rocky slopes with wonderful agility, and in about an hour reached, and rested for a few minutes at, the summit level, whence there was a fine view of the quiet bay of Trangisvaag(Trongisvgur)which lay before us. We now descended to Ordevig(ravk), where we were kindly welcomed. Arrangements were speedily made for a meeting. Meanwhile a cloth, beautifully clean and white, was spread on the table, foreshadowing the hospitality about to follow, of which we partook to our refreshment. Soon after eleven, about forty came together, and a nice open meeting it proved, in which Asbjorn Kloster had much freedom.</p>
<h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Tvroyri</h3>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">From hence we proceeded to Frodbo(Froba), crossing the bay in a boat. Too many of the people were away to allow of our holding a meeting; so we passed on to Tverra(Tvroyri), and met a remarkably cool reception. After some delay, we were shown an uninhabited house of the better sort, where we were told a meeting might be held if we went no further than a small kitchen, as it would not be convenient to have the other rooms made dirty. So we passed on, and soon found a merchant ready and willing to give us his assistance, and whose wife promptly prepared some refreshment for us. Tverra(Tvroyri)is a poor spot, as merchant stations inFaroeare apt to be, from the prevalent use of intoxicating drink. We feared for the meeting greatly, as there were several who had been evidently drinking, near the house. At the hour appointed, very few came, but in a little time one after another drew together, until a company of forty or more had assembled; to whom the words of warning and entreaty were freely spoken, under some sense of the love of God, and the tender compassion which, in sparing mercy, was near to gather them. From Tverra(Tvroyri)we proceeded in a little boat to Trangisvaag(Trongisvgur), and went thence on foot overland, rising for about an hour ere we reached the summit of a mountain ridge. The evening was fine, and the air refreshing. We descended at length by a mountain pass singularly steep and rugged, and, about half-past nine, reached our quarters at Qualboe(Hvalba), whence we had started on Wednesday,the28th.</p>
