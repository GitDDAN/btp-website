The Gifts of the Spirit (10 Lessons)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lesson
Two </strong></p>
<p><strong>Lesson
Title:</strong> The Word of Wisdom </p>
<p><strong>Text:</strong> '... to one is given by the Spirit the
word of wisdom.' 1 Corinthians 12:8. </p>
<p><strong>Introduction: </strong>What is the Word
of Wisdom?<strong> </strong></p>
<p>The list of the gifts of the Spirit begins
with a Word of Wisdom. </p>
<p>The fact that a Word of Wisdom is listed
first reveals the important character of the gift.</p>
<p>A Word of Wisdom is not natural wisdom that
can be derived from knowledge and experience.</p>
<p>A Word of Wisdom is supernaturally imparted
wisdom from the Spirit of God that can only be known through the omniscience of
God.</p>
<p><!--[if !supportLists]-->1)     <!--[endif]-->A Word of Wisdom may reveal the outworking of Gods eternal plan and
purpose of God.</p>
<p><!--[if !supportLists]-->2)     <!--[endif]-->A Word of Wisdom may reveal what is going to happen in the future so
that Gods people can act accordingly.</p>
<p><!--[if !supportLists]-->3)     <!--[endif]-->A Word of Wisdom may reveal an action that must be to taken because
of an event yet to happen.</p>
<p><strong>Comparison between a
Word of Wisdom and a Word of Knowledge.</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>A Word of Wisdom is a revelation relating
to what will happen. It concerns things
in the future.</p>
<p>A Word of Knowledge is a revelation of what
is happening or has happened. It
concerns things present and things past.</p>
<p>A Word of Wisdom provides information
concerning the plan and purpose of God so that a person can act with confidence
and assurance. </p>
<p>A Word of Knowledge provides information to
guide and to break down barriers.</p>
<p>A Word of Wisdom provides information
concerning an action that needs to be taken because of a future event, or
information about a future event allowing the person to decide what to do.</p>
<p>A Word of Knowledge provides information
regarding current events so a person can decide what should be done. </p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Examples of a Word of Wisdom:</strong></p>
<p>A Word of
Wisdom can be: </p>
<p>1)    
a warning of a future disaster like 9/11</p>
<p>2)    
a warning of danger such as avoiding a car accident.</p>
<p>3)    
an encouragement concerning the future, for instance, an end to a time of
trial.</p>
<p>4) an encouragement regarding the character
of a persons ministry</p>
<p>5)    
a revelation of what God will do concerning a persons ministry. </p>
<p>6)    
a word of guidance regarding whether to do something or not to do
something. </p>
<p>7) a word giving information regarding the
future so that we are not surprised by what happens. </p>
<p><strong>A Word of Wisdom from experience: </strong></p>
<p>The Holy
Spirit may give a Word of Wisdom to warn us so that we
will not </p>
<p><!--[if !supportLists]-->1)     <!--[endif]-->enter into a wrong association people can appear honest when they
are not. </p>
<p><!--[if !supportLists]-->2)     <!--[endif]-->enter into a business deal that will be disastrous we do not know
future events that may happen. </p>
<p><!--[if !supportLists]-->3)     <!--[endif]-->take a particular person with us on a particular trip a wrong
person can cause big problems especially in regard to the gospel. </p>
<p>We do not have to know why; we must trust
the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Holy Spirit can lead us
through a Word of Wisdom to </p>
<p><!--[if !supportLists]-->1)     <!--[endif]-->associate with the right person;</p>
<p><!--[if !supportLists]-->2)     <!--[endif]-->do a particular business transaction; </p>
<p><!--[if !supportLists]-->3)     <!--[endif]-->take someone with us on a particular trip.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Personal
Testimony: </strong>A
Word of Wisdom can be a word to do something because of what will happen.</p>
<p>In 1985 the Holy Spirit led me to India. The family I went to were living in poor
conditions at that time. It was
difficult for me to be there as I had bad stomach trouble and my nose kept
bleeding because of the heat. But it
was a very important mission trip as the Lord linked us to the ministry in
Rajasthan. </p>
<p>On my way home, when I was waiting for the plane at Delhi airport, I was at the
front of the queue to go out to a bus that would take us to the
plane, but as the queue started to move I had the thought to get out
of the queue and go to the back.</p>
<p>It seemed strange, but I did it.</p>
<p>Then, when I walked out to the bus a man looked
at me and said Are you travelling alone?'
He took my boarding pass and gave me a business class boarding pass. It was a wonderful journey home. </p>
<p>Obedience to the Word of Wisdom brought
great personal blessing.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Main Points</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.
A Word of Wisdom in Scripture. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Book of Acts.</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>a) Ananias</strong> - Revealing the plan and
purpose of God in regard to ministry.</p>
<p>Paul was known for his hatred of the
Church.</p>
<p>No Christian would have approached him
without supernatural revelation.</p>
<p>Acts 9:15-16. Word of Wisdom came through Ananias to Paul.</p>
<p>Chosen vessel. </p>
<p>Will face persecution.</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><strong>Gifts operating
 together.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Ananias received a Word of Knowledge concerning Pauls location He is at the Street
called Straight. </p>
<p>Acts 9:11.</p>
<p>Then Ananias was
sent by the Holy Spirit with a Word of Wisdom.
</p>
<p>Also gifts of healing Paul received his
sight. Acts 9:12.</p>
<p><strong>b) Agabus</strong></p>
<p>Agabus was a prophet.</p>
<p>A prophet will operate the gifts of a Word
of Wisdom and a Word of Knowledge.</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><strong>Revealing a future
 catastrophe. Famine. Acts </strong><strong>11:28</strong><strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Church took action and made provision for
poor in Jerusalem. Acts 11:29.</p>
<p>Word of Wisdom did not tell Church what to
do. Church decided. </p>
<p>Combination of divine
revelation and human reasoning. </p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><strong>Revealing Pauls
 future imprisonment. Acts </strong><strong>21:11</strong><strong>.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Holy Spirit reveals what will happen.</p>
<p>Church wrongly tried to persuade Paul not
to go. </p>
<p>Paul ignored their pleas.</p>
<p>Word of Wisdom was confirmed to Paul in
every city by the believers.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion: A Word of Wisdom must be used rightly.</strong></p>
<p>It is
possible to receive a Word of Wisdom and make wrong decisions because we
misunderstand what the Holy Spirit is saying.</p>
<p>Knowledge and experience are necessary in
understanding what the Holy Spirit is saying.</p>
<p>It is easy to move from a Word of Wisdom to
give our own advise or thoughts.</p>
<p>This does not make a person a false
prophet. </p>
<p>But it can bring discouragement when
something does not happen - the misuse of this gift can also produce
scepticism.</p>
<p>We must be careful not to mistake an
emotional response to a particular situation or problem as a Word of Wisdom .</p>
<p><strong>2.
Testimonies concerning a Word of Wisdom.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>a)
Examples from Church History</strong></p>
<p>We find the Word of Wisdom in operation in
Church history especially during times of revival. </p>
<p>The 16th century Reformation was a time of
great revival.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Story:</strong> English Reformation</p>
<p>I once went on a tour with a group who
believed the manifestations of the Spirit ceased when the whole canon of
scripture had been written. </p>
<p>When we were at Canterbury, England
we were told how a martyr under the persecution of Bloody Mary in 1555 had
called out as he died, 'we will be the last to die in this persecution'. At the same time a believer in the prison
told the other imprisoned believers not to fear because none of them would
die. </p>
<p>The next day Queen Mary known as Bloody
Mary died and the prisoners were released. </p>
<p>It is ironic that the tour group who spoke
about these events in Church History also teach that the gifts of the Spirit
ceased after the full canon of scripture was written. </p>
<p>The martyrs were operating in the gift of a
Word of Wisdom. </p>
<p><strong>b)
Examples from Personal experience</strong></p>
<p><strong>Personal testimony</strong> </p>
<p>A Word of Wisdom is a revelation concerning
the plan and purpose of God.</p>
<p>Early in my Christian experience a preacher
telephoned me and asked if he could come to see me. I was at work and so I told him that I would
come to him during my lunchtime. </p>
<p>He told me things concerning the ministry
God had given me. The things he told me
were a confirmation of what was already on my heart. This word of wisdom was a great encouragement
to me. </p>
<p>When God uses a believer in a Word of
Wisdom it does not mean he or she has the ministry of a prophet. God uses many believers to give a Word of
Wisdom to the Church. </p>
<p><strong>3.
Why is the Word of Wisdom necessary today?</strong></p>
<p>It is as
necessary today as it was in the days of the book of Acts. </p>
<p>The Word
of Wisdom enables the Body of Christ to know the plan and purpose of God. </p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>a)
A Word of Wisdom will build up ministries.</strong></p>
<p>This was
seen in the Book of Acts when Ananias came to Saul of
Tarsus (Acts 9:15-16) Saul was the great enemy of the Christian
believers but Ananias could approach him without fear
because of a Word of Wisdom.</p>
<p>A Word of
Wisdom will<strong></strong></p>
<p><!--[if !supportLists]-->        
<!--[endif]-->Provide direction by revealing Gods plan and purpose. </p>
<p><!--[if !supportLists]-->        
<!--[endif]-->Recognise developing ministry gifts.
</p>
<p><!--[if !supportLists]-->

<p><!--[if !supportLists]-->        
<!--[endif]--></p>
<p><!--[if !supportLists]-->        
<!--[endif]-->Produce boldness so that the believer can be fearless in the face of
trials, persecution and danger. </p>
<p><!--[if !supportLists]-->        
<!--[endif]--></p>
<p><!--[if !supportLists]--><!--[endif]--></p>
<p><!--[if !supportLists]--><!--[endif]--></p>
<p><!--[if !supportLists]--><!--[endif]--></p>
<p><!--[if !supportLists]--><!--[endif]--></p>
<p><!--[if !supportLists]--><!--[endif]--></p>
<p><!--[if !supportLists]--><!--[endif]--></p>
<p><!--[if !supportLists]-->        
<!--[endif]-->Bring encouragement in the face of difficulties and trials.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>b)
A Word of Wisdom gives warning to the body of Christ so that the church
can be prepared.</strong></p>
<p>The Word
of Wisdom enables the Church to take appropriate action before hand.</p>
<p>This was
seen in the book of Acts when Agabus revealed by a
Word of Wisdom that there would be a famine.
Acts 11:28.</p>
<p>The
action the Church took brought great blessing to the poor believers in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>A Word of Wisdom will</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Reveal future events so preventative or supportive measures can
 be taken.</li>
<li>Reveal times of difficulty and trials so the church will not be
 shaken by what is happening</li>
<li>Reveal future attacks of the enemy so the church can be
 diligent in fulfilling its mission.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>c)
A Word of Wisdom can save lives, and prevent a tragedy or loss.</strong></p>
<p>The Word
of Wisdom enables believers to take preventative action.</p>
<p>This is
seen in the Book of Acts when Paul was shipwrecked. Acts 27:31-32.</p>
<p>A Word of
Wisdom will save lives by</p>
<p><!--[if !supportLists]-->        
<!--[endif]-->Preventing an accident</p>
<p><!--[if !supportLists]-->        
<!--[endif]-->Preventing a crime</p>
<p><!--[if !supportLists]-->        
<!--[endif]-->Prevent a person doing something
that will have bad consequences.</p>
<p>If the
Word of Wisdom is disobeyed the consequences may be disastrous. </p>
<p>It is
important to recognise when God speaks by a Word of Wisdom and act accordingly.
</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary: </strong></p>
<p>A Word of Wisdom</p>
<p><!--[if !supportLists]-->1)     <!--[endif]-->Was needed in the Acts of the Apostles to guide, warn, prepare and
encourage the church.</p>
<p><!--[if !supportLists]-->2)     <!--[endif]-->Has been seen in operation throughout Church history.</p>
<p><!--[if !supportLists]-->3)     <!--[endif]-->Is necessary today to encourage the church especially during times
of trial or persecution.</p>
