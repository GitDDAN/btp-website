                            <h2>Details Concerning the Roman Armour</h2>

                            <p>Scripture puts the armour into two groups:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Fixed pieces</strong> (attached to the body): The Belt, The Breastplate, and The Shoes</li>
                                <li><strong>Moveable pieces</strong>: The Shield, The Helmet, and The Sword</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>The Roman soldier had more armour than Paul mentioned:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><em>The Pillum</em> - a long throwing spear</li>
                                <li>A dagger attached to his belt</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>The armour Paul mentioned was necessary in <strong>close combat fighting</strong> with the enemy:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>We cannot keep our distance in spiritual warfare</li>
                                <li>We cannot rely on the skill of others</li>
                                <li>We must be ready to wrestle against the enemy ourselves</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>An army fights together, but a soldier who cannot use the armour will soon be defeated in the battle.</p>

                            <h3>The Complete Armour (Panoply)</h3>
                            <p>Paul uses the Greek word '<em>panoplia</em>' meaning complete armour. It comes from two Greek words: 'pas' (all) and 'hoplon' (weapon) - literally 'all the weaponry'. A weak area gives opportunity for the enemy.</p>

                            <p>Notice what is <strong>not</strong> mentioned:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The javelin (used in long distance fighting)</li>
                                <li>The dagger (used for stabbing deceitfully in the back)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The armour of God does not use deceit, craftiness, or cunning. This is carnality.</p>

                                <h4 class="font-semibold text-amber-800 mb-2">Historical Note: The Sicarii</h4>
                                <p class="text-amber-900 text-sm mb-0">In the 1st century, Jewish Zealots called the Sicarii used to fight the Romans by using a dagger to stab in the back in big crowds. The historian Josephus hated them and considered their actions were the reason for the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70.</p>
                            </div>

                            <h2>Introductory Story: The Maori Hauhau Warriors</h2>

                            <p>Not only must the Christian soldier put the armour on, he or she must be certain to wear <strong>the right armour</strong>. Having faith in the wrong armour will not protect us.</p>

                            <div class="bg-amber-50 border border-amber-200 rounded-lg p-4 my-6">
                                <h4 class="font-semibold text-amber-800 mb-2">The Hauhau Warriors (1864-65)</h4>
                                <p class="text-amber-900 text-sm">During the New Zealand Maori Wars, Te Ua Haumene claimed that the angel Gabriel had revealed to him that bullets could not harm a warrior who shouted "Pai Marire, hau, hau!"</p>
                                <p class="text-amber-900 text-sm">Those who followed him were known as the Hauhau warriors. They had great courage and were incredibly daring because they had no fear of the enemy's weapons. But their belief was wrong.</p>
                                <p class="text-amber-900 text-sm mb-0">On May 14, 1864, 120 Hauhau warriors moved without fear towards enemy guns on Moutoa Island. Within minutes 80 lay dead or injured. Their armour was only words - but the words had no power (1 Corinthians 4:20).</p>
                            </div>

                            <p>We must wear the right armour in order to stand against the attacks of the enemy. If we do not wear the right armour, we can be very sincere in our beliefs but we will still be defeated.</p>

                            <h2>Main Points</h2>

                            <h3>1. The Armour of God Requires a Close Relationship with Christ</h3>

                            <div class="bg-green-50 border border-green-200 rounded-lg p-4 my-4">
                                <p class="mb-0">Putting on the whole armour of God means <strong>putting on Christ</strong>.</p>
                            </div>

                            <blockquote>
                                <strong>Romans 13:14</strong> "But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof."
                            </blockquote>

                            <p><strong>Every piece of armour reveals Christ:</strong></p>

                            <p><strong>The Fixed Parts:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>The Belt of Truth</strong> - The doctrine of Christ (2 John 1:9), The word of Christ (Colossians 3:16)</li>
                                <li><strong>The Breastplate of Righteousness</strong> - The righteousness of Christ (2 Corinthians 5:21)</li>
                                <li><strong>The Shoes of the Gospel of Peace</strong> - Christ is our peace (Ephesians 2:14)</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>The believer must stand firm on Christ with the fixed pieces of armour. They must never be taken off.</p>

                            <p><strong>The Moveable Parts:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>The Shield of Faith</strong> - Protects from external attacks; nothing can stop the believer who holds it (Hebrews 11)</li>
                                <li><strong>The Helmet of Salvation</strong> - Covers our minds; protects from attacks on the mind. We must know who we are in Christ.</li>
                                <li><strong>The Sword of the Spirit</strong> - The word of God to attack and defend. The believer must use it with skill (Revelation 12:15)</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>2. The Armour of God Requires Watchfulness at All Times</h3>

                            <p>Being prepared for warfare means always keeping the armour on.</p>

                            <div class="bg-amber-50 border border-amber-200 rounded-lg p-4 my-6">
                                <h4 class="font-semibold text-amber-800 mb-2">Illustration</h4>
                                <p class="text-amber-900 text-sm mb-0">A police woman in London on October 24, 1997, took off her body armour. When she broke down the door of a flat, she was stabbed in the chest. The armour must be on all the time.</p>
                            </div>

                            <ul>
                                <li>The enemy will strike when we least expect. The time we are at ease is the time of greatest danger.</li>
                                <li>David was led into sin one evening when he arose from bed and walked on the roof of his palace (2 Samuel 11:2). He was not prepared - the sin happened quickly. The consequences were disastrous.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <blockquote>
                                <strong>Amos 6:1</strong> "Woe to them that are at ease in Zion..."
                            </blockquote>

                            <h3>3. The Armour of God Requires Discipleship</h3>

                            <p>The believer must be skilful in using the armour.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Every believer is called to discipleship - a disciple is a learner</li>
                                <li>We are learning to be like Jesus</li>
                                <li>It takes skill to stand against the devil</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Look at Jesus when He was tempted (Matthew 4:1-11). He skilfully handled the scriptures to defeat the devil.</p>

                            <blockquote>
                                <strong>1 Peter 5:8-9</strong> "Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: Whom resist stedfast in the faith..."
                            </blockquote>

                            <blockquote>
                                <strong>1 Corinthians 10:13</strong> "There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape."
                            </blockquote>

                            <h3>4. The Armour of God Must Be Put On with Courage</h3>

                            <p>The battlefield is not a place for those who are weak in heart (Revelation 12:11).</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>When we serve the Lord, we will encounter the enemy</li>
                                <li>Those who do not preach the Gospel will not face the same conflict</li>
                                <li>If we do not have a heart for the fight, we will preach a watered-down gospel</li>
                            </ul>

                            <blockquote>
                                <strong>2 Timothy 4:2</strong> "Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine."
                            </blockquote>

                            <ul>
                                <li>When we are filled with the Holy Spirit, we will be filled with <strong>boldness</strong> (Acts 4:31), <strong>great joy</strong> (Acts 13:52), and <strong>courage</strong> (Acts 4:8)</li>
                            </ul>
