When I came to eat the Apple puff there was nothing but some crumbs in the bag. The cake had no substance.

Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering; Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do you.<span> And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness. Colossians 3:12-14.</span><span> Humility is not considering ourselves to be small when we are really great.

Meekness is in contrast to self righteousness that pulls others down.</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"&gt; Meekness takes the pressure to relief burdens. (v2)<span> Bearing burdens requires strong shoulders. Trials produce strength. A person who is puffed up cannot do it because there is no substance to his or her character. Baros (Greek) "</span>burdens<span class="italic text-gray-600">" means</span>"</span>heaviness, weight, burden, trouble<span class="italic text-gray-600">".<span> It relates to</span>pressure.<span> A puffed up person has no substance in character and will not be able to bear the burdens of one who has fallen.</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Story:</b>Bearing burdens means carrying someone else's burden. This means carrying the difficulties associated with the problem for someone in need.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">If we are not moved by a spirit of meekness then we are likely to blame the person for being in that difficult situation.<span> The burden may be carried but it is not done in love. There will be no eternal reward.</span>1 Corinthians 12:3<span> <span class="italic text-gray-600">"And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profits me nothing."</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>3.</strong> Meekness does not trust in self but trusts in the Lord.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Jeremiah 17:7-8,<span> "</span>Blessed is the man that trusts in the LORD, and whose hope the LORD is. For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreads out her roots by the river, and shall not see when heat comes, but her leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.<span class="italic text-gray-600">"</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>&gt; Meekness trusts the Lord<span class="italic text-gray-600">'s goodness and leading.
