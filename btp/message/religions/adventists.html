<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-GB">Theme</span></b><span lang="EN-GB">:Beware of following teachers who claim
revelatory knowledge in regard to end time prophecy. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-GB">Introduction</span></b><span lang="EN-GB">: </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Seventh Day Adventism arose through William
Miller's (1782-1849) teaching that the second coming of Christ would take place
in 1844 and Ellen G White's claim of prophetic ministry. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The teaching of 'keeping the sabbath' was endorsed
through the prophetic ministry of Ellen G White but did not originate with
her. She was following the teaching of
the Seventh Day Baptists. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The major characteristic of Seventh Day Adventism
is the private interpretation of scripture by Ellen G White.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Beware any cult with its own interpretation of
scripture.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The Bible does not need interpreting. It does need to be understood and this is
done through knowledge of the scriptures as a whole, </span><span lang="EN-GB"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref">2 Corinthians 3:16-17</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-GB">Introductory
illustration</span></b><span lang="EN-GB">:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Leaders of cults and heresies will claim that supernatural
manifestations have taken place as a confirmation of their message.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Many years ago some friends of ours were drawn into
false teaching. They followed the
teachings of a woman who claimed that supernatural manifestations such as the
stigmata (the wounds of Christ appearing in the body) appeared in her
body. These claims of 'supernatural
characteristics'were designed to make
her followers believe that her interpretation of scripture could not be wrong
because she walked so closely with the Lord.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In a similar fashion, it was claimed that Ellen G
White held at an arm's length an 18 pound Bible for 45 minutes while in a
trance. Although there is no evidence
to substantiate this claim, many Adventists hold the story to be true.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The conclusion drawn is that if the Spirit of God
moved so mightily through Ellen G White then her teaching must be inspired of
God. We must not follow those who claim
to be supernaturally empowered by the Spirit. We are to be followers of Christ through His word. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">a)Began
with the error of setting dates for the Lord's return. Adventism developed out of the great
religious revivals in the </span><span lang="EN-GB">USA</span><span lang="EN-GB"> during
the first half of the 19th century. There was great expectation that the Second Coming of Jesus would soon
come. William Miller setting a date for the Lord's return.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Answer:The
Lord warned His disciples against setting dates. Jesus told his disciples to watch and be
ready for His return.</span><span lang="EN-GB"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref">Matthew 24:42</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> 'Watch therefore: for you know not what

Artaxerxes 1 decreed the rebuilding of </span><span lang="EN-GB">Jerusalem</span><span lang="EN-GB">.2300 years from 457 BC = 1844 AD. Note - there was no year 0; 1 BC was followed
by 1 AD.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">'Then I
heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain saint which
spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the
transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be
trodden under foot? And he said unto me,
Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be
cleansed.'</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Originally Miller believed the coming of Christ
would be between March 1843 and March 1844, but when this did not happen then
he changed the date to </span><span lang="EN-GB">October
 22, 1844</span><span lang="EN-GB">. The
failure of this event to happen became known as the Great Disappointment.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">b)Interpreting scripture privately. Following the Great Disappointment, Adventism divided into two
movements; The Open Door and The Shut door.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The Open door continued to fix dates for the Second
Coming. The Shut door held that
probation for sinners had ended. Ellen
Harmon maintained that God had shown her in a vision that probation for sinners
had ended on October 22 and Christ would soon return. When Christ did not return then Hiram Edson
maintained that Christ's heavenly mission moved from the </span><span lang="EN-GB">Holy
 Place</span><span lang="EN-GB"> to the </span><span lang="EN-GB">Most
 Holy Place</span><span lang="EN-GB"> in heaven, and
began the 'final atonement' for sinners. The sect then began world-wide missions work.</span></p>

teaching is a denial of the Finished work of </span><span lang="EN-GB">Calvary</span><span lang="EN-GB">.</span><span lang="EN-GB"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref">Hebrews 10:12</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB">, shows that Christ sat down on the right hand of
God. No priest could sit down in the
holy of holies, but Jesus sat down in the Father's presence because Christ's atoning
work was completed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">c)The
development of legalistic rules. Around
1850 the doctrine of 'keeping the Sabbath' came into the Church.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Joseph Bates of the 'Seventh Day Baptists' was able
to convince the movement of the need to 'keep the Jewish Sabbath'.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The doctrine was introduced after Ellen Harmon
White claimed to have received a vision confirming the doctrine.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Ellen G White - dietary laws obligatory.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Answer: see book of Galatians. Error in the Church will always lead back to
the Old Testament.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><span>2.</span></span><span><span lang="EN-GB">The Scriptures of Seventh Day Adventism</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Adventists hold that the Bible is the inspired word
of God and that Ellen G White is a 'Messenger from God'.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Ellen G White writings are not held to be
scripture, but she is held to be 'the Spirit of prophecy' and an 'infallible
commentator' on the Bible.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Adventists accept that all her writings are in
agreement with the Bible.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">This is how they reason:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">All Ellen G White's writings are in agreement with
the Bible.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Adventists follow the teachings of Ellen G
White.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Adventists follow the teaching of the Bible.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The problem is that the conclusion is wrong because
the first proposition is wrong. Ellen G
White's teaching is not in agreement with scripture.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Answer:Ellen
G White interpreted scripture privately - for instance the doctrine of 'the
Shut Door'. The Bible cannot be
privately interpreted.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">2 Peter
1:</span><span lang="EN-GB">19-21 </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">'We have also a more sure
word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that
shines in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your
hearts:Knowing this first, that no
prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the
will of man: but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.'</span></p>

establish the </span><span lang="EN-GB">Adventist</span><span lang="EN-GB">Church</span><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Received answers to questions through her many

angels who told her what to write.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Seventh Day Adventism was incorporated in 1861. The
HQ was at </span><span lang="EN-GB">Battle Creek</span><span lang="EN-GB">, </span><span lang="EN-GB">Michigan</span><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Following the death of E.G. White the SDA built
schools, missions, medical works, and evangelised the SDA message around the
world.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Adventism has the largest Protestant school system.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Universities Loma Linda in </span><span lang="EN-GB">California</span><span lang="EN-GB"> and
Andrews in </span><span lang="EN-GB">Michigan</span><span lang="EN-GB">.SDA has between 6,000,000
and 7,000,000 members.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><span>3.</span></span><span><span lang="EN-GB">The teachings of Seventh Day Adventism </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">(1) The Primary doctrine of Adventism - keep the
Sabbath.SDA maintains that the Sabbath is commanded in the Moral Law (Ten
Commandments). The Ten Commandments are
held to be binding for all time. The Mark of the Beast of<span class="scripture-ref"> <span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref">Revelation 13:16-18</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>
is held to be Sunday observance in place of the Sabbath. Apostasy is blamed for changing
the seventh day for a first day.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Answer:The
Sabbath speaks of the rest of Christ - See<span class="scripture-ref"> <span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref">Hebrews 4:1-11</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>. Entering into His rest means becoming
partakers of Christ by faith.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">(2)The
Dietary Laws and vegetarianism</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">SDA claims that Leviticus 11 apply to all.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Pork, scaleless fish, shellfish, birds other than
fowl, reptiles, most mammals, are forbidden foods.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Emphasises vegetarianism.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">No alcohol, smoking etc. Coffee and tea drinking is not encouraged.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Answer: All
food is good to be received with thanksgiving, </span><span lang="EN-GB"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref">1 Timothy 4:1-5</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">(3) Atonement</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Adventism teaches this is an ongoing event.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">They reject the belief that Atonement was completed
on the cross.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">E.G. White taught that Christ entered the </span><span lang="EN-GB">Most
 Holy Place</span><span lang="EN-GB">October 22, 1844</span><span lang="EN-GB">. Prior to this time Christ ministered in the </span><span lang="EN-GB">Holy
 Place</span><span lang="EN-GB">. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Answer:</span><span lang="EN-GB">Hebrews </span><span lang="EN-GB">10:12</span><span lang="EN-GB">
'Finished work'.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">(4)Redemption</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Adventism is divided into two groups regarding
salvation.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The left wing believes 'salvation is through
acceptance of Christ alone'. Considers
'keeping the Sabbath, dietary laws' to be evidence of the fruit of the Spirit.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The right wing holds that sin committed before
conversion is forgiven at conversion but then the person can become sinless
through close relationship with Jesus. It teaches that Christ was born with a tendency to sin and shows that a
person can become sinless like Christ.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">E.G. White took a position between 'Justification by
faith' and 'perfectionist' and is held by both sides to have advocated their
position. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Answer:<span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref">Romans 5:1</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> 'having been Justified by faith, we have peace with God'</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">(5)Teaching
of a remnant</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Seventh Day Adventists hold that only they fulfil
the conditions of the remnant.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Revelation </span><span lang="EN-GB">12:17</span><span lang="EN-GB">'And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and
went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of
God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.'</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Answer:New
Testament Christianity is the body of Christ ;1 Corinthians 12.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">(6)Prophecy</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">E.G. White contradicted herself.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In 1884 she stated that the interpretation of the
vision regarding the Shut Door was wrong.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Answer:</span><span lang="EN-GB"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref">Deuteronomy 18:22</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> </span><span lang="EN-GB">'When a prophet
speaks in the name of the LORD, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that
is the thing which the LORD has not spoken, but the prophet has spoken it
presumptuously: you shall not be afraid of him.'</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">E G White's interpretation of the 'Shut Door'
vision cannot be separated from the message of the prophecy - her admission is
evidence that she was 'prophecying presumptuosly' and she should therefore be
disregarded as a prophet. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-GB">Summary:</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><span>1.</span></span><span><span lang="EN-GB">The origins of Adventism are associated with
William Miller erroneously setting a date for the Lord's return, and Ellen G
White's claim to a prophetic gift and messages received through angelic
visitations. No man knows the day nor
hour of the Lord's return and wemust
beware of false prophets.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><span>2.</span></span><span><span lang="EN-GB">The writings of Ellen G White are held by
adventists to be scriptural, but upon examination her teachings are seen to
contradict scripture.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><span>3.</span></span><span><span lang="EN-GB">The teachings of Adventism go against the
teaching of New Testament Christianity. It retains obligation to keep the Old Testament Laws,anddenies
the 'finished work of Christ'.</span></span></p>
