Whatever we do, do as unto the Lord.</li> </ul> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Main Points</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">1.The ministry of the Holy Spirit in the New Testament Church is characterized by the Gifts, Ministries and Workings of the Holy Spirit operating through the members of the body of Christ, (1 Corinthians 12: 4-6).</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-4" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal">The Holy Spirit is like a river moving into three streams giving, serving, and energising.</li> </ul> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span> This is the time of the Holy Spirit and God when the Holy Spirit flows out of the body of Christ,</span> (John <st1:time hour="7" minute="37">7:37</st1:time>-39).</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span> We receive the anointing of the Holy Spirit by coming to the Lord Jesus Christ and drinking from Him.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span> This means to desire Him above all else. The anointing of the Holy Spirit will depend upon how much we love Christ.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"&gt; <span dir="LTR">The gifts, ministries and workings of the Holy Spirit can be seen operating in the Old Testament and in the New Testament.<span> They are clearly seen in the ministries of Elijah and Elisha</span>. If the power of the Holy Spirit was seen in the Old Testament then how much more should this power of the Holy Spirit be seen working today through the body of Christ? Wherever believers gather together the gifts, ministries and energising</span> power of the Holy Spirit should be evident. Without the power of the Holy Spirit the Church will only grow in numbers according to the extent that we are able to draw people ourselves this is not New Testament Christianity..</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>&gt; <span dir="LTR">It is not the Holy Spirit that has changed in the New Testament; the difference is that the Holy Spirit now operates through the body of Christ and not just through selected leaders. The witness of the body of Christ needs the empowering of the Holy Spirit.<span> When the Holy Spirit moves in power through the body of Christ crowds will be drawn without the need for large amounts of money to be spent in advertising or TV promotion. It is essential that every member of the body of Christ is actively involved in the anointed ministry of the Holy Spirit.</span></span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>2.</strong> <span dir="LTR">The gifts, ministries and energising power of the Holy Spirit enable the church to minister in power.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>&gt; <span dir="LTR">There are different gifts, but it is the same Spirit,</span> 1 Corinthians12:4. The nine gifts are listed, 1 Corinthians12:8-10.<span> The gifts are provided by the Holy Spirit through the body of Christ to build up the body. The gifts were also in operation in the Old Testament but the gift of tongues and interpretation of tongues is only seen in the New Testament. This is wonderful Holy Spirit empowerment in worship.</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"&gt; <span dir="LTR">Different ministries, same Lord,</span> 1 Corinthians12:5.<span> The word for ministries means service. Serving is a characteristic of the Holy Spirit and serving characterises</span> the disciples of Jesus. The greatest must become the least in Gods kingdom. Jesus washed the disciples feet,</span>John 13:12-16.<span> To be effective witnesses to Christ we must be empowered by the Holy Spirit in serving. The Holy Spirit ministry (serving) is also seen in the Old Testament. God used the widow woman in Zarephath</span> to minister to Elijah,1 Kings 17:9.<span> All ministry should be anointed serving.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>&gt; <span dir="LTR">Different activities, same God</span> (v6).<span> The Greek word <span class="italic text-gray-600">"<i>energematon</i>"</span> means workings. It is the word energy this where we receive the energising</span> power of the Holy Spirit. All of the Christian life is spiritual and needs the energy of the Holy Spirit. Whatever we do, do as unto the Lord. The energising</span> power of the Holy Spirit is seen in the Old Testament. Elijah was energised by the Holy Spirit to pray,James 5:16.<span> James tells us that we should pray with the same expectations as Elijah. See course Prayer (1)</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>3.</strong> <span dir="LTR">The New Testament Church is a body and every member of the body of Christ should be actively involved in the anointed ministry of the Holy Spirit.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>&gt; <span dir="LTR">We are the body of Christ because the life of Christ is dwelling in us (Colossians 1:27)</span>.<span> The believer is crucified with Christ, buried with Christ and raised in newness of life, and is now seated in heavenly places in Christ. This is why the Holy Spirit was able to come upon the 120 believers on the Day of Pentecost</span>(Acts 2).<span> The promise of the Holy Spirit is to every believer. Peter preached that the promise if to</span>as many as be afar off, that includes us.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span dir="LTR">The day of Pentecost experience is essential for the body of Christ to function as a New Testament Church.<span> Jesus told His disciples to wait until they were empowered by the Holy Spirit. They had already been commissioned to go into all the world and preach the gospel but they were to wait for the empowerment of the Holy Spirit. It is the same today. We need the empowering of the Holy Spirit to be effective witnesses to Christ.</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">All the body of Christ should be ministering to one another and to the lost in the power of the Holy Spirit.<span> Not everyone is called to leadership but everyone is called to be minister in the power of the Holy Spirit. We must all be witnesses to the saving power of the Lord Jesus Christ and when we speak to others we need the anointing of God to make the words pierce right into the heart. When Paul stood a prisoner before the Roman ruler it was the ruler who trembled. This is the anointing of the Holy Spirit.</span><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p>
