<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Port soy on the
Banffshire coast knew something ~f delayed action regarding the evidence of the
awakening of the Spirit. Only a few men and women were converted at </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Yarmouth</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB">, but they
were genuine. God moved in 1923, there were people already prepared. One such
was George Currie. He had been a hard case before his.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">conversion, but
when he found Christ the change was remarkable. His entire family eventually
became Christians. Another was Jock "Tartan" Pirie. These two men
were ready to take responsibility when God moved two years later. One day while
they were praying for the town, two young Salvation Army officers, who were
based in the neighbouring </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span lang="EN-GB">village</span></st1:placetype><span lang="EN-GB"> of </span><st1:placename><span lang="EN-GB">Cullen</span></st1:placename></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB"> came to Portsoy to do "Self Denial" collecting for Army
funds. A request was made for them to come to the village and hold meetings.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It was no
coincidence that a Captain Leed, who hailed from Thurso was the officer in
charge of the Salvation Army at Cullen. He was a member of the Army team who
had seen tremendous blessing around </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Norwich</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">East Anglia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span lang="EN-GB"> during 1921. In charge of the work was the spiritual giant Albert
Osborne, who was later to become General Osborne. This young highlander was being prepared for the move of God in Portsoy years before it took place.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Lieutenant Towns
and his co-worker realised that a few people in Portsoy were burdened over the
spiritual state of their town. The officers began to pray along with them.
Captain Leed testified that there were many occasions that Lieutenant Towns
would weep all night for Portsoy. One day the junior officer asked for
permission to go to Portsoy to conduct services. Immediately Captain Leed
agreed. He had been praying that his co-worker would volunteer to hold meetings
in that town. It was a known fact that many had boasted that Port soy was not
touched by any revival. Services were arranged to start during the week of </span><st1:date day="25" month="3" year="1923"><span lang="EN-GB">25th March 1923</span></st1:date><span lang="EN-GB"> in the form of open-air meetings at the Shorehead and indoors at
the Christian Insititute.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The open-air
meeting took the usual form of others conducted by the Salvation Army. There
was bright singing and testimonies from those who had come along with young
Lieutenant Towns from Cullen. He then gave a simple message. Crowds gathered to
hear. A man who was saved that night tells the story with great conviction.
"I was just going into my teens when I heard of the transforming power of
Christ in the lives of the men who returned from </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Yarmouth</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> in
December 1921.Somehow Portsoy was never
the same. Every Saturday night at </span><st1:time hour="21" minute="0"><span lang="EN-GB">9 p.m.</span></st1:time><span lang="EN-GB"> I would go to watch the
drunks come out of the pub. The fights would be tremendous with blood flowing
from the hardened men as they fought fiercely with each other.Fights also took place at the Shorehead.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Little did some of
these men realise that a few months later they would be standing and testifying
to the power of Christ in the very same place. Why?Because Christ had come into their
lives." </span></p>

testimonies, Lieutenant Towns went into the ring and spoke. · This is your
chance to get saved," he said. He then took off his jacket and laid it on
the ground. Then he fell on his knees and prayed. Immediately Alex Pirie, James
Slater and myself responded to the appeal before a great crowd who knew us
well. We openly got on our knees beside the young officer and trusted
Christ.Alex Pirie was later drowned in
the early days of the seine-net fishing on the </span><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Dogger Bank</span></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">. We were asked to
testify for Christ right there and then at the Shorehead. Real assurance

got saved." The spiritual awakening had begun in Portsoy.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The services in
the Christian Institute were times of refreshing.Many a night the hall would be packed to
capacity with 500 people inside.The
cinema was closed and later taken over by the Salvation Army.People walked from Whitehills, Fordyce,
Sandend and Cullen to these meetings and there were many conversions. A certain
Jimmy Hay was drunk when he cried out, "Lord be merciful to me a
sinner." As he rose from his seat he was sober. It was said that there
were 400 souls saved in Portsoy and the surrounding villages at that time.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">There were some
outstanding conversions in Portsoy, but that of Jimmy Hay was a case of
immediate transformation. His brother tells of how the news was broken to
Jimmy's mother. "A neighbour cried out, 'Your Jimmy has got saved in
Portsoy tonight.' I cannot remember my mother's reply, but she stayed out of
bed to see the result of the work of grace. In due course Jimmy came home and
cried out, 'Mither, here's a new man tae ye the nicht.'My mother stood for a moment and then sang,</span></p>
