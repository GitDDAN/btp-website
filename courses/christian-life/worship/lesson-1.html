When the worshipper has gone up to worship the entrance into worship is by thankfulness and praise,</span><span>be thankful unto him, <i>and</i> bless his name.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>2)</strong> The Worship of a Surrendered Life (Romans 12:1). The worshipper moves higher into worship by presenting his or her life as a living sacrifice.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Worship moves from here into a new realm.<span> It is the place of anointed worship. It is also the place of brokenness because the anointing flows out of broken vessels.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>3)</strong> The Worship of an Anointed Life (Acts <st1:time hour="2" minute="11">2:11</st1:time>). <span>This worship begins with the Day of Pentecost experience. The Holy Spirit takes over the leadership of the worship through the believer.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The anointing brings opposition from those who resist the moving of the Holy Spirit.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>4)</strong> The Worship of Fellowship with His Sufferings (Acts <st1:time hour="5" minute="41">5:41</st1:time>). <span>The opposition from those who resist the Holy Spirit provides a new opportunity to worship. It is the anointed worship of those who rejoice in being counted worthy to suffer shame for the Lord.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">These leads to the highest place of worship where the worshipper rejoices in Gods eternal plan and purpose that was fulfilled through Jesus Christ and is now being proclaimed through the Church.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>5)</strong> The Worship of Knowing the Eternal Plan and Purpose of God (Ephesians 3:1-13). <span>This is the place of angelic worship. The angels always see the glory of God (Isaiah 6:3)</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">There is another realm of worship that is reached when the worshipper enters into eternity.<span> The worshipper is lifted to worship in heaven where he or she continues to offer anointed worship to the Lord. There is no end to true worship. Death for the worshipper is a continuation of worship from time into eternity. The greatest joy of worship in eternity is that the worshipper will see the King in His beauty, face to face.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Main Points</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>1.</strong> Worship is the heart of the Christian life.<span> Disciples of Christ desire to be like Him in Holiness and to seek after Him.</span></p> <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-4" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal">Holiness, Psalm 29:2<span> Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.</span></li> </ul> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Without worship Christianity will be associated with living a good life, but holiness is more than this.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Holiness comes through relationship and worship must come out of holiness.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Holiness looks to the Lord but morality looks only at outward actions.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Matthew <st1:time hour="5" minute="20">5:20</st1:time><span> For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed <i>the righteousness</i> of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Worship will keep the Church from becoming legalistic and judgmental of others.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The disciple of Christ must learn to worship at all times, and in all situations and circumstances.</p> <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-4" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal">Passion.<span> How excited are we about seeking after the Lord?</span>Jeremiah 29:13 And ye shall seek me, and find <i>me</i>, when ye shall search for me with all your heart.<span> If believers have no excitement about seeking after the Lord, then the Christian life becomes mundane and unattractive to others. The Church that attracts people to Christ is filled with passion for Christ. A fruitful Christian is a person filled with the joy of the Lord expressed through continuous praise and thanksgiving.</span></li> </ul> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">This can be compared to the excitement of a love relationship.<span> It is the excitement of being together that makes the relationship so special.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>2.</strong> Worship is born out of our relationship with the Lord.<span> Christ must be at the centre of our life. Pauls prayer for the Ephesian believers was that Christ would dwell in their hearts.</span>Ephesians <st1:time hour="3" minute="17">3:17</st1:time> That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love.</p> <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-4" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal">Christ dwelling in our hearts.<span> The message give your heart to Jesus is the message for the Church. It was to the</span><st1:place><st1:placename>Laodicean</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Church</st1:placetype></st1:place> that the Lord said Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me. Revelation 3:20.<span>The extent of our relationship with Christ is dependent upon how much we desire Him. The heights that we reach in worship will always depend upon the closeness of our relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ. We are able to know the same place of worship in our own experience as the disciples knew in Bible days.</span></li> </ul> <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-4" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal">Love the fruit of our relationship with Christ.<span> When Christ dwells in our hearts then our lives will be filled with the love of God. Love will make us servants to one another</span>(John <st1:time hour="13" minute="34">13:34</st1:time>-35).</li> </ul> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>3.</strong> Worship must be in spirit and in truth, (John <st1:time hour="4" minute="24">4:24</st1:time>).<span> Worship must be in a right manner. Singing Christian songs is capable of moving the emotions whether it is worship or not. Only believers who have gone up to worship and come into His presence in a right manner are true worshippers.</span></p> <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-4" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal">In spirit - from the innermost part of our being.<span> True worship includes the thoughts and desires of the heart.</span>(Psalm <st1:time hour="19" minute="14">19:14</st1:time>)</li> </ul> <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-4" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal">In truth - founded upon the word of God.<span> When David brought the</span><st1:state><st1:place>Ark</st1:place></st1:state> to Jerusalem God chastised the people when they worshipped in a wrong manner, (2 Samuel 6).</li> </ul> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>4.</strong> Effective ministry in the body of Christ must always be worship.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">All the great men and women of faith in scripture were first and foremost worshippers.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Ministry to others flows out of worship that is rooted in love for Christ.</p> <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-4" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal">Love for Christ the only motivation for ministry, John 21:15-17. </li> </ul> <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-4" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal">Love of Christ will keep us faithful.2 Corinthians 5:14.</li> </ul> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>5.</strong> Our worship will determine how we will enter into heaven.2 Peter 1:10-11 <span>Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:<span> For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</span>Salvation is the free gift of God, Ephesians 2:8.<span> It is dependent upon faith alone in what Jesus Christ has done for us. But how we enter into heaven is dependent upon our relationship with Christ. The Bible says we need to be concerned about the way we will enter into heaven. The only way to be ready for eternity is to always be living in the place of worship.</span></span></p> <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-4" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal">An abundant entrance into heaven is the prize of those who go up to worship.<span> This means an entrance that is rich in eternal possessions.</span></li> </ul> <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-4" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal">The reward of the worshipper is the joy of glorifying the Lord.<span> Every believer will one day stand at the bema seat of Christ.</span>2 Corinthians 5:<span>10<span> For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things <i>done</i> in <i>his</i> body, according to that he hath done, whether <i>it be</i> good or bad.</span>This is not a judgment concerning sin.<span> The believer has already passed through this judgement I Christ. This is a judgment of reward. The question on this day will be how much did we love Christ. The greatest joy on that day will be the joy of knowing that our lives brought honour to the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.</span></span></li> </ul> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Illustration:</b><span> Olympic Games - the athlete brings honour to the nation.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The person who wins gold at the Olympic brings honour to his or her nation.<span> Often an athlete will shed tears when the national anthem is played and the national flag is raised. The joy of bringing honour to ones nation is a great achievement.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>6.</strong> There is no higher calling than the call to worship, (Psalm 27:4).</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Those who seek to worship the Father in spirit and in truth must have one desire.</p> <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-4" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal">One desire to worship.<span> David desired only to worship the Lord.</span></li> </ul> <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-4" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal">One desire to know Christ.<span> The joy of knowing Him more and more.
