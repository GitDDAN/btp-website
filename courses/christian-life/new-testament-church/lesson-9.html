When he or she goes down in the water they are identified with Christ in His burial. When he or she comes out of the water they are identified Christ in His resurrection.

Hamish had also received the baptism with the Holy Spirit. He shared with me how he had come to understand that true scriptural water baptism was by total immersion. This was a problem because he only performed infant baptisms at his church, and he could not be baptised by total immersion at his own church. He had no peace in his heart until he went to the nearby Baptist church and was baptised there by total immersion. He continued to be the minister of the Church of Scotland but the presbytery was not pleased with him. When his case was discussed they were willing to take into consideration his previous record of good behaviour and more or less said to him "</span>don<span class="italic text-gray-600">"t do it again"</span>.

It is the beginning of our relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ that will last for all eternity.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>2)</strong> The next baptism is by the body of Christ when the believer is baptised in water as an outward confession of faith in Christ.<span> This is not necessary for salvation, but it is done in obedience to the scriptures. If we love the Lord we will obey His word. The believer is identifying him or herself publicly with the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>3)</strong> The third baptism is when the Lord Jesus baptises the believer with the Holy Spirit.<span> This baptism is entirely dependent upon our relationship with Christ. We must desire the Lord Jesus in order to receive this outpouring of the Spirit. It is not given as a demonstration of power. The Holy Spirit is given so that the body of Christ will be worshipping witnesses to Christ. This baptism brings the believer into the higher realm of worship in the anointing.</span></p> </div><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>The Holy Spirit</b></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>
