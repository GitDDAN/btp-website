<p class="Mso Normal"><span lang="EN-GB">Glorification
begins with regeneration, develops through the process of sanctification, and
is completed at the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p class="Mso Normal"><span lang="EN-GB">It is

<p class="Mso Normal"><span lang="EN-GB">Regeneration
- New life;</span></p>
<p class="Mso Normal"><span lang="EN-GB">Sanctification

<p class="Mso Normal"><b><span lang="EN-GB">Introductory
Story:</span></b><span lang="EN-GB">The beauty of Jesus seen in the life of the
believer.</span></p>
<p class="Mso Normal"><span class="Gram E"><span lang="EN-GB">New life in Christ.</span></span></p>
<p class="Mso Normal"><span lang="EN-GB">There was a Tuesday night in the <span class="Gram E">Summer</span> of 1975 when I was brought into a completely new
life. My life changed completely from
that night. People I worked with saw the
difference instantly. The new life
changed the way I spoke, the way I worked and gave me completely different
desires. Old habits dropped away and a
new way of life took their place.I did
not make new resolutions; I had new life.</span></p>
<p class="Mso Normal"><span lang="EN-GB">I had made commitments to Christ before
this but my life was changed when I received new life.</span></p>
<p class="Mso Normal"><span lang="EN-GB"><b>Discipleship</b></span></p>
<p class="Mso Normal"><span lang="EN-GB">It was easy to witness at work and people were amazed at the change they saw in my life.I knew it was not me but Christ in me. My life was completely changed by the power of the gospel. But when I left that work to go to Bible School, I came into a Christian environment and was not always received in a nice way, I became more defensive.</span></p>
<p>I found it difficult to rely upon His strength where before it had been easy. Jesus said my yoke is easy, <span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref">Matthew 11:28-30</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>. Living for Christ is learning to let Him live
in us. This is discipleship. Sometimes it is more difficult to live for Christ in a Christian environment than it is to live for Him in a secular environment.</p></span>
<p class="Mso Normal"><span lang="EN-GB">Resurrection</span></p>
<p class="Mso Normal"><span lang="EN-GB">The glorious hope of the believer is to be
changed physically into the likeness of Jesus. I have been in the clouds <span class="Gram E">many time</span> in an aeroplane but one day those who belong to
Jesus will be there without an aeroplane. </span></p>
<p class="Mso Normal"><b><span lang="EN-GB">Main
Points:</span></b></p>
<p class="Mso Normal"><span lang="EN-GB">1.<b>The glory of His life in us.</b></span></p>
<br/>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Glorification begins when the
believer is raised to new life in Christ. <span class="Gram E">The resurrected
life of Christ in us.</span></span></p>
<p class="Mso Normal"><span lang="EN-GB">Col</span><span lang="EN-GB">1:27</span><span class="Gram E"><span lang="EN-GB">,To</span></span><span lang="EN-GB"> whom God would make known
what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is
Christ in you, the hope of glory:</span></p>
<br/>
<p class="Mso Normal"><span lang="EN-GB">A Christian is a person who has the life of
Christ in them.</span></p>
<p class="Mso Normal"><span lang="EN-GB">A person who confesses Christ may not have new life. </span></p>

The parable of the wise and foolish virgins.</span></p>
<p class="Mso Normal"><span lang="EN-GB">10 virgins only 5 were saved.</span></p>
<p class="Mso Normal"> <span lang="EN-GB">All professed to be believers but only 5 had oil.</span></p>
<p class="Mso Normal"><span lang="EN-GB">How can we tell who are saved?</span></p>
<p class="Mso Normal"><span class="Gram E"><span lang="EN-GB">By their fruit the power of
God in the life of the believer.</span></span></p>
<p class="Mso Normal"><span lang="EN-GB">Natural fruit takes time to grow.</span></p>
<p class="Mso Normal"><span lang="EN-GB">Jesus cursed the fig tree because there were no
figs. The tree did not have fruit
because it was not the season but the fig tree symbolised </span><span lang="EN-GB">Israel</span><span lang="EN-GB"> and God expected to see fruit in His people at
all times.</span></p>
<p class="Mso Normal"><span lang="EN-GB">What is the initial evidence of salvation?</span></p>
<p class="Mso Normal"><span lang="EN-GB">Initial evidence is the same. The fruit of the Spirit will be seen, love,
joy, peace etc. will be as the new believer expresses forgiveness, joyfulness
and love. </span></p>
<p class="Mso Normal"><span lang="EN-GB">The extent that the fruit is seen will increase
as the believer grows in Christ but the fruit will be seen from the moment of
salvation. </span></p>
<p class="Mso Normal"><span lang="EN-GB"><span>2.</span></span><span><span lang="EN-GB">The glory of His power in us. Glorification
takes place in the believer through the process of sanctification.</span><span lang="EN-GB">It is the ministry of the Holy Spirit in the life of the believer as he or she is changed into the image of Jesus.</span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref">2 Corinthians

beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image
from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</span></p>
<p class="Mso Normal"><span lang="EN-GB">The first epistle of Peter puts
it this way: </span><span lang="EN-GB">1 Peter </span><span class="Gram E"><span lang="EN-GB">5:10</span></span><span class="Gram E"><span lang="EN-GB">But</span></span><span lang="EN-GB"> the God of all grace, who

concerned.</span></p>

<p>The glory that shall be revealed is the life of Christ in us.</p>
<p>His life is seen in His people right now through the fruit of the Spirit.</p>
<p>His love shows the beauty of His character</p>
<p>in contrast to the self seeking nature of the world.</p>

raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on <span class="Spell E">incorruption</span>,

and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass

<p>Corruption (defilment and decay) changed to incorruption. The defilement of sin will be removed from us. No battle for the mind; no pull of sin on the heart; no conflict of will. Pure and holy in every area of our life. Right now we should aim to be holy; and desire holiness because then we will only know holiness.</p>
<p>Mortal (sickness and death) changed to immortality. Death will no longer be known. Right now we are united with the One who is eternal life but our body still dies. When Jesus returns the resurrection life will change our mortal body into an immortality.</p>
