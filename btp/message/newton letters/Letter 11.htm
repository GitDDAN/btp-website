<p><strong>LETTER XI.</strong></p>

<p><strong></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>John Newtons </em></strong></p>

<p><strong></strong></p>

<p><strong></strong></p>

<p>DEAR SIR,</p>

<br clear=all>

<p>A few days
after I was thus wonderfully saved from an unforeseen danger we sailed for
Antigua, and thence proceeded to Charles Town, in South Carolina. In this place
there are many serious people, but I knew not how to find them out; indeed, I
was not aware of a difference, but supposed that all who attended public
worship were good Christians. I was as much in the dark about preaching, not
doubting but whatever came from the pulpit must be very good. I had two or
three opportunities of hearing a dissenting minister named Smith, who, by what
I have known since, I believe to have been an excellent and powerful preacher
of the gospel; and there was something in his manner that struck me, but I did
not rightly understand him. The best words that men can speak are ineffectual
till explained and applied by the Spirit of God, who alone can open the heart.</p>

<p>It pleased
the Lord for some time that I should learn no more than what He enabled me to
collect from my own experience and reflection. </p>

<p>My conduct
was now very inconsistent. Almost every day, when business would permit, I used
to retire into the woods and fields (for these, when at hand, have always been
my favourite oratories); and, I trust, I began to taste the sweets of communion
with God in the exercises of prayer and praise. Yet I frequently spent the
evening in vain and worthless company. Indeed, my relish for worldly diversions
was much weakened, and I was rather a spectator than a sharer in their
pleasures, but I did not as yet see &quot;that God requires an absolute
separation.&quot; (2 Cor. vi. 14-18.) Yet, as my compliance with custom and
company was chiefly owing to want of<i> </i>light rather than to an obstinate
attachment, and the Lord was pleased to preserve me from what I <i>knew </i>was
sinful, I had, for the most part, peace of conscience, and my strongest desires
were towards the things of God. As yet I knew not the force of that precept,
&quot;Abstain from all appearance of evil&quot; (1 Thess. v. 22), but very
often ventured upon the brink of temptation; but the Lord was gracious to my
weakness, and would not suffer the enemy to prevail against me. I did not break
with the world at once (as might in my case have been expected), but I was
gradually led to see the inconvenience and folly of one thing after another and
when I saw it the Lord strengthened me to give it up. But it was some years
before I was set quite at liberty from occasional compliances in many things in
which at this time I durst by no means allow myself.</p>

<p><strong><em>John
Newton marries Mary (Feb 1, 1750)</em></strong></p>

<p>We
finished our voyage, and arrived in L---, when the ship's affairs were settled
I went to London, and thence (as you may suppose) I soon repaired to Kent. More
than seven years were now elapsed since my first visit. No views of the kind
could seem more imaginary, or could subsist under greater discouragements than
mine had done; yet, through the overruling goodness of God, while I seemed
abandoned to myself, and blindly following my own headstrong passions, I was
guided by a hand that I knew not to the accomplishment of my wishes. Every
obstacle was now removed. I had renounced my former follies, my interest was
established, and friends on all sides consenting, the point was now entirely
between ourselves, and, after what had passed, was easily concluded.
Accordingly our hands were joined on the 1st of February, 1750.</p>

<p>The
satisfaction I have found in this union, you will suppose, has been greatly heightened
by reflection on the former disagreeable contrasts I had passed through, and
the views I have had of the singular mercy and providence of the Lord in
bringing it to pass. If you please to look back to the beginning of my sixth
letter (<a href="Letter 6.htm">Letter VI</a>), I doubt not but you will
allow that few persons have known more either of the misery or happiness of
which human life as considered in itself is capable. How easily, at a time of
life when I was so little capable of judging (but a few months more than
seventeen), might my affections have been fixed where they could have met with
no return, or where success would have been the heaviest disappointment. The
long delay I met with was likewise a mercy; for had I succeeded a year or two
sooner, before the Lord was pleased to change my heart, we must have been
mutually unhappy, even as to the present life. Surely mercy and goodness have
followed me all my days.</p>

<p>But, alas!
I soon began to feel that my heart was still hard and ungrateful to the God of
my life. This crowning mercy, which raised me to all I could ask or wish in a
temporal view, and which ought to have been an animating motive to obedience
and praise, had a contrary effect. I rested in the gift, and forgot the Giver.
My poor narrow heart was satisfied. A cold and careless frame as to spiritual
things took place, and gained ground daily. Happy for me the season was
advancing, and in June I received orders to go to L--. This roused me from my
dream. I need not tell you that I found the pains of absence and separation
fully proportionate to my preceding pleasure. It was hard, very hard, to part,
especially as conscience interfered, and suggested to me how little I deserved
that we should be spared to meet again. But the Lord supported me. I was a
poor, faint, idolatrous creature; but I had now some acquaintance with the way
of access to a throne of grace, by the blood of Jesus (Hebrews x. 19, 20), and
peace was soon restored to my conscience. Yet, through all the following voyage,
my irregular and excessive affections were as thorns in my eyes, and often
made my other blessings tasteless and insipid. But He, who doth all things
well, overruled this likewise for good. It became an occasion of quickening me in
prayer, both for her and myself; it increased my indifference for company and
amusement; it habituated me to a kind of voluntary self-denial, which I was
afterwards taught to improve to a better purpose.</p>

<p>While I remained in England we
corresponded every post; and all the while I was on the sea afterwards, I
constantly kept up the practice of writing two or three times a week (if
weather and business permitted), though no conveyance homeward offered for six
or eight months together. My packets were usually heavy, and as not one of them
at any time miscarried, I have to the amount of near two hundred sheets of
paper now lying in my bureau of that correspondence. I mention this little
relief, as I contrived to soften the intervals of absence, because it had a
good effect beyond my first intention.
It habituated me to think and write upon a great variety of subjects,
and I acquired insensibly a greater readiness of expressing myself than I
should have otherwise attained. As I gained more ground in religious knowledge
my letters became more serious, and at times I still find an advantage in
looking them over, especially as they remind me of many providential incidents,
and the state of my mind at different periods in these voyages, which would
otherwise have escaped my memory.</p>

<p><strong><em>John Newton takes command of a ship</em></strong></p>

<p>I sailed from L--- in August, 1750,
commander of a good ship. I have no ordinary events to recount from this
period, and shall therefore contract my memoirs, lest I become tedious; yet I
am willing to give you a brief sketch of my history down to 1755, the year of
my settlement in my present situation. I had now the command and care of thirty
persons. I endeavoured to
treat them with humanity, and to set them a good example; I likewise
established public worship, according to the liturgy, twice every Lord's-day
officiating myself. Farther than this I did not proceed while I continued in
that employment.</p>

<p>Having now
much leisure, I pursued the study of Latin with good success. I remembered a
dictionary this voyage, and procured two or three other books; but still it was
my hap to choose the hardest. I added Juvenal to Horace, and for prose authors
I pitched upon Livy, Cresar, and Sallust. You will easily conceive, sir, that I
had hard work to begin (where I should have left off) with Horace and Livy. I
was not aware of the difference of style. I had heard Livy highly commended,
and was resolved to understand him. I began with the first page; and laid down
a rule, which I seldom departed from, not to proceed to a second period till I
understood the first, and so on. I was often at a stand, but seldom discouraged.
Here and there I found a few lines quite obstinate, and was forced to break in
upon</p>

<p>my rule, and give them up, especially as
my edition had only the text, without any notes to assist me. But there were
not many such; for before the close of that voyage I could, with a few
exceptions, read Livy from end to end, almost as readily as an English author.
And I found, in surmounting this difficulty, I had surmounted all in one.
Other prose authors, when they came in my way, cost me little trouble. In
short, in the space of two or three voyages I became tolerably acquainted with
the best classics. (I put all I have to say upon this subject together.) I read
Terence, Virgil, and several pieces of Cicero, and the modern classics,
Buchanan, Erasmus, and Casimir. At length I conceived a design of becoming
Ciceronian myself, and thought it would be a fine thing indeed to write pure
and elegant Latin. I made some attempts towards it; but, by this time the Lord
was pleased to draw me nearer to Himself, and to give me a fuller view of the
blessings I possess in Him (1 Cor. i. 30, 31), and, for His sake, I was made
willing to part with all my newly-acquired riches. I began to think that life
was too short (especially my life) to admit of leisure for such elaborate
trifling. Neither poet or historian could tell me a word of Jesus, and I
therefore applied myself to those who could. The classics were at first
restrained to one morning in the week, and at length quite laid aside. I have
not looked in Livy these five years, and I suppose I could not now well understand
him. Some passages in Horace and Virgil I still admire, but they seldom come in my way. I prefer Buchanan's <i>Psalms </i>to a whole shelf of Elzevirs. But thus much I have gained, and more than
this I am not solicitous about, so much of the Latin as enables me to read any
useful or curious book that is published in that language. About the same time,
and for the same reason that I quarrelled with Livy, I laid aside the
mathematics. I found they not only cost
me much time, but engrossed my thoughts too far; my head was literally full of
schemes. I was weary of cold, contemplative truths, which can neither warm nor
amend the heart, but rather tend to aggrandize self. I found no traces of this
wisdom in the life of Jesus, or the writings of Paul. I do not regret that I
have had some opportunities of knowing the first principles of these things,
but I see much cause to praise the Lord that He inclined me to stop in time,
and, whilst I was &quot;spending my labours for that which is not bread,&quot;
was pleased to set before me &quot; wine and milk without money and without
price.&quot;</p>

<p>My first voyage was fourteen months, through various scenes of danger and
difficulty, but nothing very remarkable; and as I intend to be more particular
with regard to the second, I shall only say that I was preserved from every
harm; and having seen many fall on my right hand and on my left, I was brought
home in peace, and restored to where my thoughts had been often directed,
November 2nd, 1751.</p>

<p>I am, Sir,</p>

<p>Yours.</p>
