The animal will then not be ready for the danger and will have no opportunity of preventing itself from being caught. The animal can be led into the trap by the smell of food but this is not always necessary as an animal that is unaware of danger can easily walk into the trap. Camouflage is also essential so that the trap appears to be part of the normal environment. This will prevent the animal from having any warning that it is in danger.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Satan traps people in the same way.<span> He works in the dark so that his traps are well hidden and then he seeks to kill, steal and destroy. He uses camouflage to disguise himself and through deception he seeks to entrap people. Satan traps people by anaesthetising the mind. He can trap people who do not think. Many Christians have been deceived by the clever wiles (schemes) of the devil because they were unaware of the danger.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The word wiles is the Greek word "</span>methodeia<span class="italic text-gray-600">" (Ephesians</span><st1:time hour="6" minute="11">6:11</st1:time>).<span> It refers to the devils clever methods in the art of cunning, deceitfulness, craftiness, and trickery, and we must be aware of his schemes. The way to overcome Satans schemes is by knowing his methods and being strong in the Lord and in the power of His might by putting on the whole armour of God.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Exposition:</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">We must be able to discern Satan's methods of deception.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>1.</strong> He disguises himself to deceive the church.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Illustration:<span> Fifth columnists - the enemy within. Those who claim to be leaders of the church but are working for the enemy.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>> He masquerades as an angel of light.<span> (</span>2 Corinthians 11:13-14)<span> For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.</span>Spiritual warfare concerns the building up of the Church.<span> When the Church is being built up, spiritual warfare will take place, but the gates of hell will not prevail against the <i>ekklesia</i>, Matthew 16:18.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"> The devils ministers come to deceive the body of Christ as the ministers of righteousness,<span> (</span>2 Corinthians <st1:time hour="11" minute="15">11:15</st1:time>) Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.<u><span> </u>Those who follow the ministers of Satan will be led astray.<span> We must not accept everything that is said in the name of Christ, but we must discern truth from error.</span>(Ephesians 4:14)<span> That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">True ministry will bring freedom.<span> The ministries in the body of Christ are for building up the body of Christ in the truth of the scriptures.</span>(Ephesians 4:11-12) for the edifying of the body of Christ.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">False teachers and leaders seek to bring the people into bondage to themselves.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>2.</strong> He roars to produce fear</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"> Satan seeks to silence the Church through fear. The body of Christ must be careful and watching because the devil comes as a roaring Lion to produce fear, despair and discouragement.(1 Peter 5:8-9) Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking whom he may devour.We are in a spiritual warfare, the devil roars to make us afraid of the fight.<span> He wants to make us afraid of living for God in holiness then we will become an easy prey for the enemy.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>> He seeks to make the church afraid to preach the gospel.<span> Fear will stop us from being witnesses to Christ. Afraid because the message of the cross is foolishness to the world. If we are ashamed of the gospel then we will replace it with a more acceptable message - modernism and liberalism. Afraid because of the reaction of the people. Fear of ridicule and being regarded as strange.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"> He seeks to make the Christian afraid of serving Christ.<span> He aims to produce fear, despair, and the feeling of utter hopelessness in the child of God. This can come in the form of thoughts in the mind, or through circumstances. He roars who do you think you are? He attacks the child of God by making them look at themselves. You call yourself a child of God if people only knew what you are really like.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>> We can only overcome by our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.Resist, steadfast in the faith, 1 Peter 5:9.<span> We need to stand firm upon Gods Word in the power of the Holy Spirit,</span>This is the victory that overcomes the world, even our faith, (1John 5:4).</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>3.</strong> He lies to bring bondage.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>> He lies to bring the body of Christ into bondage.<span> The body of Christ must know the word of God because the devil is a Liar perverting the truth. We must learn to be able to discern truth from error. At times the devil appears to be a friend, but he is always a liar because this is his nature. If he tells the truth it is for the purpose of deceiving. He wears different masks, but his aim is the same: to steal, to kill, and to destroy (John</span><st1:time hour="10" minute="10">10:10</st1:time>).</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"> He lies to enslave people.<span> He lied to Eve in the garden you shall not die, Genesis 3:4. Jesus said the devil was by nature a liar and the father of liars, John 8:44. Lying is the devils nature. Jesus recognised that the religious leaders were followers of the devil because they followed his lies, John 8:44. In contrast to the nature of the devil, Jesus said I am the Way, the Truth and the Life, no one comes to the Father but by Me John 14:6.</span></p> <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-4" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal">The lie stands in opposition to the truth. (2 Thessalonians 2:11) And for this reason God will send them strong delusion, that they should believe the lie. The lie enslaves; the gospel sets people free.</li> </ul> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>4.</strong> He comes as a friend to lead us astray.<span> The devil tries to cast doubt on Gods word by approaching us in a friendly manner and offering an easier path.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"> The devil comes as a friend to make us avoid the cross.<span> Jesus discerned the devil was speaking through Peter when he was trying to be nice to Him. (</span>Matthew 16:22-23)<span> Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from you, Lord: this shall not be unto you. But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get behind me, Satan: you are an offence unto me: for your mind is not on the things that be of God, but those that be of men.</span> Behind the friendly words that Peter spoke was the temptation to go against the Fathers will and take an easier route.<span> Note: God did not spare His own Son from going the way of the cross because there was no other way that we could be saved.</span>Isaiah 53:10, Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he has put him to grief: when You shall make his soul an offering for sin.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>> He comes as a friend to rob us of the friendship of the Holy Spirit. And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; (John <st1:time hour="14" minute="16">14:16</st1:time>).The body of Christ must know the friendship of the Holy Spirit to keep from being deceived by the friendship of the enemy.<span> The Comforter, the Holy Spirit is the True Friend who will guide us in Truth. (</span>John 16:13)<span> Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will show you things to come.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"> The Holy Spirit has been given to us as our inheritance in Christ.Ephesians 1:13-14<span> "</span>In whom ye also <i>trusted</i>, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.<span class="italic text-gray-600">"</span>The devil seeks to rob us of our eternal inheritance.<span> In this respect the devil is also working with eternity in mind. The devil is not only working to stop people getting saved, he is seeking to stop Christians from receiving an eternal reward that will glorify the Lord Jesus Christ.</span><span> <span>"</span>Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if you do these things, you shall never fall: For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.<span class="italic text-gray-600">" (2 Peter 1:10-11)</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The devil comes to steal, to kill, and to destroy but all the might of hell cannot stop the <i>ekklesia</i> (the body of Christ) when she has put on the whole armour of God and is strong in the Lord and in the power of His might.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">We must be wise by knowing the scriptures; we must be watching at all times for ourselves and one another by being prayerful; and we must be ready by applying the armour of God in our daily lives.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Summary:</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Beware the devil's methods:</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>1.</strong> The devil comes to deceive as an angel of light.<span> The armour of the belt of truth will protect us.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>2.</strong> The devil comes as a roaring lion to silence the body of Christ through fear.<span> The armour of the shield of faith will keep us from fear.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>3.</strong> The devil lies to bring us into bondage.<span> The sword of the Spirit is our means of defence.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>4.</strong> The devil comes as a friend to steal our inheritance in Christ.<span> The whole armour of God enables us to stand against him.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b><span>Lesson Outline</span></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b><a href="../../../../arweb.html"><span>Course Index</a></b></p>
