<p class=MsoNormal>Just after our marriage, December 26, 1956, we applied to
the T.L.Osborn Pioneering Program for support.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Without waiting for the approval of our
application we proceeded to the place where the Lord was leading us, a remote
mountain area called Sawang, San Marcelina, in the province of Zambales.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>The people here were Negritos, the
aborigines of the Philippines.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>These people are short, black, have kinky hair, and at this time they
still practiced many kinds of superstitious beliefs.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They were treacherous and
dangerous people; they were headhunters.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>They had a superstitious belief that every full moon they had to get one
head to offer to their god, and held a feast for the whole day.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>They put the head on a pointed bamboo,
and stood it in the middle of the village.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>Then they danced around it with their bow and arrows, and spears.</p><br>

<p class=MsoNormal>We had only been there one week and they got two heads.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span><br>My wife was so scared.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>&#8220;We had better go home,&#8221; she
told me, &#8220;we might be next!&#8221;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I asked their chief, &#8220;Why those heads?&#8221;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He told me they were bad, lawless people, who were wanted by
the authorities &#8220;dead or alive&#8221;.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>When he saw my wife was scared, he told
us not to be afraid, as they would protect us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At first the Negritos were afraid of us.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>But I embraced them even though they
were odorous and dirty with runny noses.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>Then they loved us as well.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>They gave us bananas, papaya, sweet potatoes, wild pig meat, and deer
meat.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>I got clothing, rice, and
different kinds of tools for them, and also soap for washing clothes, and bath
soap.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They had never used
soap before, so they would take up to eight baths a day.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>I gave them instructions then they just
took a bath once or twice a day, and changed their clothes every day.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>They asked me why we had gone to
them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>I told them we wanted them to
know how to become a Christian.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>I
read to them from John&#8217;s Gospel chapter 1 verse 12, that as soon as we
receive Christ as Lord we become His sons and His daughters.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>This really made them happy, and they
received the Lord Jesus Christ as their Lord and<span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'> Savior</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>I baptised almost the whole
village.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Then we built a big
church.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>I put a bell there so that
when they heard the bell they all came for the service.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another belief which thy held was that when someone was sick
they would send for the witch doctor, who would play the guitar and dance to
call up the evil spirit called &#8220;the<span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:
EN-US'> Anito</span>&#8221;.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Then
they would pay whatever the witch doctor said &#8220;the Anito&#8221;
required.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Sometimes they paid one
chicken with yellow feet, two hard boiled eggs, one bottle of gin,<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>or even a pig, depending upon how
serious was the sickness.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>But one
time I went to find out what was happening.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>The witch doctor got tired dancing, yet
still &#8220;the Anito&#8221; had not come.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>When they saw me they said, &#8220;The
reason is because of<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Pastor de
Gracia.&#8221;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Then I told them
that what they are doing is of the devil.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>I explained to them that &#8220;the Lord is greater than the devil, and
even right now if you will believe with me I will pray for your loved one, and
God will heal him.&#8221;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>So they
believed, and I prayed, and praise the Lord that brother was healed instantly.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>That really excited them, and they came
to realise that what I was telling them was true.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>From that time on they always call me to
pray for their sick relatives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After several months with them, we transferred to another
village, Baliwaet, just five miles away from Sawang.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Someone else came to continue the work
in Sawang but still they cried, &#8220;Pastor, don&#8217;t go away from
us.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Why are you not loving us
anymore?&#8221;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So I told
them, &#8220;I do love you, but there are others who also need Jesus as their
personal Savior.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>I have to go and
tell them so that they can become Christians like you.&#8221;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>We encountered the same things in
Baliwaet as we did in Sawang.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>But
when the Negritos in Baliwaet saw the working power of God, they really
believed!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These people worshipped different things that looked strange
or wonderful to them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>They
worshipped fat cows, fat pigs, and even big trees with many leaves.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>When I told them about the Lord, that He
could change their lives, and save them, they are so excited and glad to
receive the Lord.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Now they are so
happy because they have made heaven their home.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>We also built a church there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From Baliwaet we moved 25 miles away to Maporac,
Cabangan.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Here the Negritos were a
bit more civilised than those in Sawang and Baliwaet. The first Sunday I
preached there was one who came, the second Sunday, two, the third Sunday, four,
then more and more came each week.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>I went from house to house, or if people were gathered under a tree I
would take the opportunity to tell them about the Lord.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>With much prayer we had a group of
believers who I baptised in water.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>One day a man came to me asking me to pray for his niece who was demon
possessed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>I went, and the Lord
delivered her.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Then her mother and
all her children began to come to the meetings.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Also the girl&#8217;s uncle received
Christ as his Savior, now he is pasturing a church in Paite, San Felipe,
Zambales.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The &#8220;Iglesia ni Cristo&#8221;, a false cult in the
Philippines who do not believe in the deity of Christ, challenged me to a
public debate in the plaza.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>This
debate was the talk of the town, and the turning point of my ministry here in
Cabangan.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>I was able to show from
the scriptures that Jesus Christ is God, and from that time many came to our
church.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>It was then that we moved
across the river from Maporac to San Juan.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>I saw the great need for Gospel workers, some came from Bible School in
Manila, but they didn&#8217;t endure, and went home.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>So I told my wife that we must pray that
God will give us a Bible school here to train young people, then they could
endure the hardship because they are familiar with the life-style.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>In 1984, Stephen and Josa Dulwich came
to see us, while we were talking together they mentioned their desire to start
a Bible school.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>I told them this is
our great desire so we can train young people to help us spread the &#8220;good
news&#8221;.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>We agreed that we
would begin in June that year.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>So I
went around announcing that we were going to begin a Bible school in Cabangan.</p>
