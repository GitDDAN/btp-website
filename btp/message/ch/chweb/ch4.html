And this is most abundant proof that there is one and the same vivifying faith, which has been preserved in the Church from the apostles until now, and handed down in truth.

He upheld Apostolic succession as the standard for determining the true Church from heretical sects, and he denied the authenticity of the sects on the basis that their bishops were not consecrated in the line of continuity from the Apostles. He believed that every Church could point out the individual to whom the superintendence of its doctrine and discipline was first committed by some one of the apostles.</span>He wrote, Let them show the origin of their churches; let them trace the succession of their bishops, and thus connect the individual who first held the office, either with some apostle, or some apostolic man who always remained in communion with the Church.<span> It is thus that the apostolic churches show their origin.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>> Augustine of Hippo (354430) wrote that it is impossible for a bishop who has been legitimately consecrated to lose his consecration or the power of conferring others.<span> This was the view that was predominantly upheld by the Roman Catholic Church.</span><span> This goes against the teaching of Paul in 1 Timothy 3.

Par.3</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">3. The blessed apostles, then, having founded and built up the Church, committed into the hands of Linus the office of the episcopate. Of this Linus</span>, Paul makes mention in the Epistles to Timothy. To him succeeded Anacletus</span>; and after him, in the third place from the apostles, Clement was allotted the bishopric. This man, as he had seen the blessed apostles, and had been conversant with them, might be said to have the preaching of the apostles still echoing [in his ears], and their traditions before his eyes. Nor was he alone [in this], for there were many still remaining who had received instructions from the apostles. In the time of this Clement, no small dissension having occurred among the brethren at Corinth, the Church in Rome despatched a most powerful letter to the Corinthians, exhorting them to peace, renewing their faith, and declaring the tradition which it had lately received from the apostles, proclaiming the one God, omnipotent, the Maker of heaven and earth, the Creator of man, who brought on the deluge, and called Abraham, who led the people from the land of Egypt, spake</span> with Moses, set forth the law, sent the prophets, and who has prepared fire for the devil and his angels. From this document, whosoever chooses to do so, may learn that He, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, was preached by the Churches, and may also understand the apostolical</span> tradition of the Church, since this Epistle is of older date than these men who are now propagating falsehood, and who conjure into existence another god beyond the Creator and the Maker of all existing things. To this Clement there succeeded Evaristus</span>. Alexander followed Evaristus</span>; then, sixth from the apostles, Sixtus</span> was appointed; after him, Telephorus</span>, who was gloriously martyred; then Hyginus</span>; after him, Pius; then after him, Anicetus</span>. Sorer having succeeded Anicetus</span>, Eleutherius</span> does now, in the twelfth place from the apostles, hold the inheritance of the episcopate. In this order, and by this succession, the ecclesiastical tradition from the apostles, and the preaching of the truth, have come down to us. And this is most abundant proof that there is one and the same vivifying faith, which has been preserved in the Church from the apostles until now, and handed down in truth.</span></p>
