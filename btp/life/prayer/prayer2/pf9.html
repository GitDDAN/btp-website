The tongues were known languages that the people around them could understand. But those who spoke in tongues did not understand what they were saying. In Acts 10v46 there is no mention that anyone understood the tongues, but they did understand when they magnified God. Peter recognised that this was the same experience that happened to them on the Day of Pentecost and that God had opened up the gospel to the Gentiles (Acts 11:15)</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">There is no mention that the believers continued to speak in tongues after the Day of Pentecost. There is also no mention of others who received the Holy Spirit continuing to speak in tongues.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">It is only in 1 Corinthians 14 where tongues are spoken of as being something a believer can do continuously.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Paul asks the question in 1 Corinthians 12v30 Do all speak with tongues, which implies that all did not speak in tongues. But in 1 Corinthians 14v5 Paul says he wished they all would speak in tongues and prophecy.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The teaching that Paul is speaking of the gift of tongues in 1 Corinthians 12v30 as opposed to a general prayer language of tongues in 1 Corinthians 14v5 does not mean that they are separate gifts. They are the same gift operated in two different ways.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Tongues refers to a person speaking an unknown language. </b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Paul states that in the law it is written with men of other tongues and other lips I will speak to this people. (1 Corinthians 14v21-22).</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">It is evident that Paul is not talking about a known language but an unknown language as he associates it with the foreign nations coming against Israel (Isaiah 33v19).</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Tongues were therefore a sign to Israel showing the consequences of their unbelief and disobedience.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">No longer is God leading a nation but now He is building His temple with His people.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Speaking in unknown tongues when the church meets together has no purpose unless the tongues are interpreted.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The primary objective when the church meets together is edification (1 Corinthians 14v26).</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">One shares a Psalm, another has a teaching, one has a tongue, a revelation, an interpretation.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Tongues need to be interpreted if all are going to be benefited.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Paul limits the number of messages in tongues to 2 or 3 times and always with interpretation (1 Corinthians 14v27).</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Two functions are associated with speaking in tongues.</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The gifts of the Spirit operate as the Holy Spirit will, but speaking in tongues serve two functions.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">1) personal for the believers personal prayer life and for building up his or her spiritual life. No interpretation is necessary.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">2)<span> public a direct message in tongues followed by interpretation of tongues.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Praying in tongues privately</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Why tongues?</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The tongue speaks from the heart.<b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">To speak with a new tongue under the control of the Holy Spirit a person must have a new heart born again of the Spirit of God.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Prophecy is the moving of the Holy Spirit upon the mind of the believer.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Divers kinds of tongues is the moving of the Spirit upon the heart of the believer.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">This is why all the gifts of the Holy Spirit are seen in the Old Testament except tongues and interpretation of tongues. This could only happen after the Holy Spirit had come upon the church on the Day of Pentecost.<b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Tongues communicate prayer, praise and worship.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Communicating in prayer what the Lord has promised He will do.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Communicating in praise and worship - what the Lord has done.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Tongues edify (build up) the believer.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Tongues strengthens us in the inner or spiritual man.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Speaking in tongues is given to speak mysteries to God in prayer.<b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">There is great power in praying in tongues.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">It is not surprising that Satan has fought hard to stop believers moving in the realm of praying in tongues.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The Lord is able to do great things through prayer, and it is not necessary for the believer to know all that he or she is praying.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The Holy Spirit is in control.<span> He is able to pray through us even when we do not know what to pray.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Romans <st1:time hour="8" minute="26" w:st="on">8:26</st1:time> Likewise the Spirit also helps our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">We are in a spiritual warfare.<span> People are bound by sin and Satan. The warfare is spiritual. Paul puts prayer with the spiritual armour of the believer.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Ephesians 6:18, Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Although this verse does not directly refer to speaking in tongues, praying in the Spirit as described in 1 Corinthians <st1:time hour="14" minute="15" w:st="on">14:15</st1:time> includes praying in tongues.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The spirit prays when we speak in tongues.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">My mind is unable to understand but the Holy Spirit is in control.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">1 Corinthians 14v2 He who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God however, in the spirit he speaks mysteries.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">1 Corinthians 14v4 He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">1 Corinthians 14v5 I wish you all spoke in tongues.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">1 Corinthians 14:14, For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">1 Corinthians 14:18 I thank my God I speak with tongues more than you all.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">1 Corinthians 14:39 Do not forbid to speak with tongues.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">In the church understanding is essential but in our personal prayer life it is not.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Pray with the spirit (tongues) and with understanding (v15)</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Sing with the spirit (tongues) and with understanding (v15)</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Paul spoke in tongues more than the Corinthians (v18)</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">But in the assembly he sought to build up the believers (v19)</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Testimony</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The leader of the church where I belonged always used to pray in tongues. He would go shopping with his wife and he would pray quietly in tongues while she did the shopping.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">He had Parkinsons disease for many years and eventually he had a stroke that left him unable to speak or move.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">I went to the hospital to visit him after he had this stroke. He was lying in bed, he couldnt speak, and he seemed to be totally unaware that I was there.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">I moved to the side of the bed so I could put my arm around him, and I said, George, Im going to pray for you.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">He had not responded to anything before but as soon as I began to pray, he started praying in tongues with me.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>The Baptism with the Holy Spirit.</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The promise of the Baptism with the Holy Spirit is given to all believers (Acts 2:39).</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">There are many Christians who never speak in tongues even though they have a great desire to do so. It is not guaranteed in scripture that everyone will speak in tongues.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">It is wrong for Christians to try and get people to speak in tongues.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">If we love the Lord Jesus Christ, and we desire to know and obey His word, then the Lord has promised that out of our innermost being will flow rivers of living water (John 7:37-38). We should not seek to speak in tongues, but we should seek Him, to know Him, and to do His will.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">There is much false teaching regarding speaking in tongues.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The evidence of the Baptism with the Holy Spirit is not speaking in tongues, it is a fervent love for the Lord Jesus Christ and a heart that seeks to love and obey His word.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">If we seek Him with all our heart then the Lord is able to fill our heart and mouth with praise and thanksgiving, causing rivers of living water to flow from our heart with words we understand and with words we do not. It is by the fruit of the Spirit that we know we are filled with the Holy Spirit. The wonderful presence of the Holy Spirit will bring an abundance of love, joy and peace.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The Charismatic Movement has put a false emphasis on speaking in tongues so we must be aware of the dangers.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Tongues can originate from three sources</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>1)</strong> Out of our own minds repeating sounds that have no meaning.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The method of praying in tongues over someone and getting them to open their mouth and speak words is not the Holy Spirit, it is manipulation.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">This encourages people to speak in tongues out of their own minds.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>2)</strong> From a wrong spirit the words may or may not have meaning, but they originate from an evil source and consequently bring an evil presence.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">This is demonic. Preachers who promote themselves can use techniques such as mesmerism to cause excitement.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The scripture tells us everything is to be done decently and in order (1 Corinthians 14:40).</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Many things done in charismatic meetings are not orderly.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">For instance, barking like dogs, laughing excessively etc. is not the Holy Spirit.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Tongues associated with this can be a wrong spirit and not just from the mind of the person.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">It is occultist and not the Holy Spirit.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>3)</span>From the Holy Spirit edifies the believer and glorifies the Lord.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Primarily for personal prayer life and not for church ministry.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Tongues in the public service must be interpreted and limited to 2 or 3 in turn.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Speaking in tongues is not mentioned in any other epistle than in 1 Corinthians chapters12-14. There is no mention of the early church speaking in tongues after the initial experience when the Holy Spirit comes upon the believers in Acts 2:4, 10:46,19:6. It should not have prominence in the church and is primarily for personal prayer. If a message in tongues is given, then it must be followed by interpretation, and there should not be more than 2 or 3 at the most.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Having corrected the error concerning the use of tongues in the church, Paul makes a clear statement to the Corinthian church to earnestly desire to prophesy and do not forbid to speak with tongues (1 Corinthians 14:39).</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The teaching that 1 Corinthians 13:8 means that tongues have now ceased, and that which is perfect is come v10 means we now have the New Testament scriptures, has moved many away from desiring spiritual gifts. Tongues will cease when Jesus returns. But whether we pray in tongues or in our known language, our desire should always be to love the Lord with all our heart and to love and obey His word.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> </div><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b><span>Prayer
