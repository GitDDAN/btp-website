<p><b>Lesson Title:Kingly Character 'Semnos'</b></p>
  Titus 2:7, 'In all things showing thyself a pattern of good
works: in doctrine showing uncorruptness, gravity (Gr. semnotes), sincerity'.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Meaning of semnos (grave)  semnotes (gravity).</p>
<p>The word semnos is translated 'grave' in
the King James Bible.</p>
<p>It is a word associated with royalty.</p>
<p>It describes kingly character.</p>
<p>Semnos is a word that embraces all of the
essential characteristics of a Christian leader.</p>
<p>All Christians are called to lead and the
kingly character of semnos should be evident in all believers.</p>
<p>'Semnos' describes a person who is serious;
thoughtful; above reproach, a person of dignity, honest; and respectful.</p>
<p>The New International Version translates
'semnos' as 'worthy of respect'.</p>
<p>A king does not act as a fool.</p>
<p>Humour is used with care.</p>
<p>A Christian should be a person who reflects
royalty.</p>
<p>In Christ we have become part of the family
of God.</p>
<p>We are sons and daughters of the living
God.</p>
<p>Heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ
(Romans 8:17).</p>
<p>Our lives should show we are the family of
God.</p>
<p><b>Story:Nominal Christians</b></p>
<p>The first time I went to India I was told
that the greatest hinderance to the gospel was not Hinduism but nominal
Christianity.The people saw the lives
of nominal Christians and rejected the message of the gospel because their
lives did not show the love and life of Jesus.</p>
<p><b>Personal
Testimony:</b> From the moment a person comes to
Christ, he or she will be watched.</p>
<p>I was 21 years of age when I became a
Christian.</p>
<p>At the time when my life was completely
turned around I was working in an office in London.</p>
<p>Before that time I cared nothing about
work. </p>
<p>Then afterwards everyone in the office saw
the total change in my character.</p>
<p>I was able to tell them how Christ had
changed my life.</p>
<p><b>The
Holy Spirit works with natural qualities.</b></p>
<p>In Christian leadership natural qualities
that make a person worthy of respect must be combined with the power of the
Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><b>All
great Christian leaders have been characterized by semnos.</b></p>
<p>Their lives enforced everything they stood
for.</p>
<p>William Wiberforce who led the campaign to
abolish the British slave trade was known to be a man of high principles. </p>
<p>William Booth led by example working with
the poor on the streets of London.</p>
<p>Charles Spurgeon was a great preacher who
was also known for his great heart for the people.</p>
<p><b>There
have been many Christian leaders wholacked this quality of 'semnos', and it has brought shame to the gospel.</b></p>
<p>Some have been associated with large
amounts of money.They are known for
their luxurious lifestyles, and multimillion dollar homes.</p>
<p>Their ministries are often surrounded by
scandal or divorce</p>
<p>Scripture tells us that these are not the
people who should be in Christian leadership.</p>
<p><b><i>Semnos</i> in the New
Testament</b></p>
<p><span>The Bible refers to <i>semnos</i> being required in men, women and young people.</span></p>
<p><span>The kingly character of <i>semnos</i> is a word used in connection with
the leadership of a man and his wife.</span></p>
<p>Overseer - respect within the family</p>
<p><span>1Ti 3:4 'One that ruleth well his own
house, having his children in subjection with all gravity (<i>semnotes</i>);'</span></p>
<p><span>Deacons:1Ti 3:8 'Likewise must the deacons be grave (<i>semnos</i>), not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of
filthy lucre;'</span></p>
<p><span>Deacons wives: 1Ti 3:11 'Even so must their
wives be grave (<i>semnos</i>), not
slanderers, sober, faithful in all things.'</span></p>
<p>It is used in connection with maturity and
experience.</p>
<p><span>The older men (presbyters) - Elders
(masculine). Tit 2:2 That the aged men be sober, grave (<i>semnos</i>), temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.</span></p>
<p><span>The older women (presbutis) - elders
(feminine). Titus 2:3 The aged women <u>likewise</u>, that they be in behaviour
as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of
good things;</span></p>
<p>It should be seen to characterize those who
teach.</p>
<p><span>Teaching by life example.Titus 2:6-7, 'Young men likewise exhort to be
sober minded.  In all things showing thyself a pattern of good works: in
doctrine showing uncorruptness, gravity (Gr. <i>semnotes</i>), sincerity'.</span></p>
<p><b>Main
Points</b></p>
<h3>1. Presenting the right image</h3>

<p>Presenting an image that is 'worthy of
respect'</p>
<p>It is not enough to say God looks at the
heart because man always looks at the outward appearance. </p>
<p>Appearances do matter.</p>
<p>Our appearance should show that we are the
family of God.</p>
<p><b>a)</b><b>God does not lead a people
in rags</b></p>
<p>When the Lord took the children of Israel
into the wilderness it was not possible for them to get materials to make new
clothes.God provided miraculously.</p>
<p>Deuteronomy 29:5'And I have led you forty years in the
wilderness: your clothes are not worn old upon you, and your shoe is not worn
old upon your foot.'</p>
<p>Our appearance should always show that the
Lord is able to provide for His people.</p>
<p>He provides naturally through work.</p>
<p>He provides through the care of the body of
Christ.</p>
<p>He provides through the promises in His
word.</p>
<p>He provides through the miraculous
provision of the gifts of the Spirit.</p>
<p><b>b)</b><b>In everyday life we learn
how to present the right image.</b></p>
<p>We use our brains so we don't have to look
miserable just because we feel bad.</p>
<p>We are not a people controlled by how we
feel on a particular day.</p>
<p>It is not hypocritical to smile at people
who irritate us.</p>
<p>Good manners require us to hide some
emotions.</p>
<p>Hypocrisy is when we say one thing and do
another.</p>
<p>The word hypocrite became associated with
pretence. </p>
<p>'Hupokrites' - Roman or Greek stage actor
who put on a large mask and magnified the voice with a mechanical devise.</p>
<p>A hypocrite is a person who preaches one
thing and does another.</p>
<p><b>Illustration:
Celebrities attract people.</b></p>
<p>Hollywood stars know how to present the right image in front of a camera.</p>
<p>They can speak with confidence.</p>
<p>They are highly honoured and respected; </p>
<p>They become great ambassadors for
organisations like the UN etc.</p>
<p>Their skill is in performing.</p>
<p>But the image presented on camera does not
always reflect the character in personal life </p>
<p>This can also be true of Christian TV.</p>
<p>In front of the camera a person can present
an image of upholding righteousness, but when the camera is not on he or she is
characterised by anger, pride, deceit.</p>
<p>Fame and success can build big ministries
but it cannot produce 'semnos'. </p>
<p>The image we present on camera must be
continued in everyday life.</p>
<h3>2. Representing the Lord.Ambassadors for Christ.</h3>

<p>An ambassador of Christ is sent with the
message of reconciliation with God.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians 5: 20, 'Now then we are
ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in
Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.'</p>
<p>The character of the ambassador must
reflect the importance of the message. </p>
<p><b>a)</b><b>The character of an
ambassador.</b></p>
<p>The ambassador is a representative.</p>
<p>Serious; thoughtful; and above reproach.</p>
<p>An ambassador will be called to account if
his or her life is not found worthy of being an ambassador.</p>
<p>Higher standard will be required from an
ambassador.</p>
<p>The ambassador will set the standard that
people associate with the kingdom or state he or she represents.</p>
<p>An ambassador cannot relax his standards
and rely upon the prestige of the nation.</p>
<p>Ambassador in scripture is the word
'presbeuo'</p>
<p>It is closely related to the word elder, a
man of experience, 'presbuteros'.</p>
<p>An ambassador is an experienced man.</p>
<p>A Christian leader must not be a novice
(neophutos - one newly brought forth), 1 Timothy 3:6.</p>
<p>For this reason that pride in a position
can destroy an inexperienced person. </p>
<p><b>Prison
Ministry</b></p>
<p>The gospel not only brings forgiveness from
sin and new life in Christ, but the gospel also makes ambassadors out of men
and women who have been lifted from sin. </p>
<p>When I was preaching in the prison in
Romania, I told the men that an ambassador is not one who goes around with his
or her head down on the ground.An
ambassador for Christ looks people in the eyes and says 'the same Jesus who
lifted me is able to lift you'.It is
exciting that the Lord has chosen the foolish things of the world.He makes ambassadors out of the worst of
sinners. </p>
<p><b>b)</b><b>Leadership without semnos</b></p>
<p>When a man or woman is put into a position
of leadership and the quality of 'semnos' is lacking, the consequences can be
disastrous.</p>
<p>Here are some of the common consequences of
leadership without 'semnos'.</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> Leadership led by self interest.</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> Leadership becomes community centred and not Christ centred.(It's not the same!)</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> Ministry gifts are not used because they become a threat to the
leadership.</p>
<p><strong>4)</strong> There is a lack of experienced leadership.</p>
<p>We are called to be ambassadors for Christ.</p>
<p>Ambassadors must live by high standards.</p>
<p>A Christian is an ambassador for Christ
every day, 24 hours a day.</p>
<h3>3. Exemplary in character. </h3>

<p>The life of a believer should stand as an
example at all times.</p>
<p><b>a)</b><b>A person of dignity.</b></p>
<p>It should be seen that the believer is
worthy of trust.</p>
<p>Honourable - fair in his or her dealings
with others.</p>
<p>Reliable - will keep his or her word and do
things well </p>
<p>Dependable - able to take on responsibility</p>
<p>Upright - not being led into wrong
dealings.</p>
<p><i>Semnos</i> does not just involve outward actions but also inward thoughts.</p>
<p><span>Philippians 4:8 'Finally, brethren,
whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest (<i>semnos</i>), whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure,
whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be
any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.'</span></p>
<p><b>Paul
tells Timothy to pray for those in authority so that we may be free to exercise
the character of semnos.</b></p>
<p><span>Timothy 2:1-2 'I exhort therefore,
that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of
thanks, be made for all men; For kings, and for all that are in authority; that
we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty (<i>semnotes</i>).'</span></p>
<p><span>When a nation is led by an evil system then
the freedom to exercise a '<i>semnos</i>'
character will come under attack.</span></p>
<p><b>b)</b><b>Sin destroys the dignity of
man.It will destroy the royal character
of the believer</b></p>
<p>Sin seeks to build on the throne of
self.It is motivated by pride and self
interest. </p>
<p>It will hide its deeds in the darkness.</p>
<p>Royal dignity does not hide.</p>
<p>Sin will cause a person to run away so that
his or her deeds are not known.</p>
<p>Sexual Immorality </p>
<p>Lies </p>
<p>Sin will demolish the dignity and kingly
character of a man or woman.</p>
<p><b>We
are to keep away from the 'appearance of evil'</b></p>
<p>1 Thessalonians 5:22'Abstain from all appearance of evil.'</p>
<p>We need to keep away from the appearance of
evil.</p>
<p>We are called to live a higher standard
than the world.</p>
<p><b>c)</b><b>Alcohol - Drunkenness
destroys the dignity of the believer.</b></p>
<p>The Bible tell us not to be drunk.</p>
<p>The world enjoys seeing people a little
drunk but alcohol will remove the 'dignity of royalty' from the character of
the believer.</p>
<p>If a Christian drinks even a little alcohol
and drives, it can bring great shame to the gospel.</p>
<p><b>Faroe
Islands</b></p>
<p>Every Summer there is a festival in the
Faroe Islands called Olavsoka.</p>
<p>Many hundreds of people walk in the town
and talk with each other.</p>
<p>But many people also get very drunk during
this festival.</p>
<p>If a Christian is seen drunk during this
festival, his royal character is lost, and it will take a long time to restore
the dignity that he had before he was seen in a drunken condition.</p>
<p>Christians are to be examples at all times.</p>
<p>This means it is necessary to live by high
standards.</p>
<p>It includes how we dress, and where we go,
as well as what we do.</p>
<h3>4. Speaking with authority.</h3>

<p><span>The words of a man or woman who has the
kingly character of '<i>semnos'</i> have
authority.</span></p>
<p><b>a)</b><b>Semnos - speaking with
kingly authority.</b></p>
<p>The word of a king must be based upon truth
</p>
<p>The authority of a king is that he has
power to perform the word spoken.</p>
<p>The believer should always speak as a king
and see that his or her words are fulfilled.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to swear by an
oath.</p>
<p>It's OK to affirm the truth of our words in
a court of law because we should always speak truthfully.</p>
<p>But sometimes it is necessary to keep silent
regarding it is not always good to say everything we know.</p>
<p>The word of King is trustworthy.</p>
<p>A promise will be kept.</p>
<p>This does not mean that we cannot take
oaths, but it means that taking an oath is not necessary as our word is true
and will be fulfilled.</p>
<p><b>b)</b><b>Living under authority</b></p>
<p>The centurion had authority because he was
under the authority of Rome.</p>
<p><span>Matthew 8:9'For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to
this <i>man</i>, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my
servant, Do this, and he does <i>it</i>.'<b></b></span></p>
<p>He did not speak by his own authority.</p>
<p>If the centurion chose to live the life of
a civilian while on active service he would lose his authority.</p>
<p>It is the same in the Christian life.</p>
<p>Authority comes from being under the
lordship of Christ.</p>
<p>Authority in prayer -answered prayer will be seen to the extent
that we walk in obedience to the word of God and closeness to Christ
(relationship).</p>
<p><span>Authority in word - speaking with spiritual
authority is like prayer and depends on obedience and relationship, but also on
outward appearance and relationship with others (<i>semnos</i>).</span></p>
<p><b>c)</b><b>Purpose of a monarchy -
able to lift a nation.</b></p>
<p>We have been brought into the family of
God.</p>
<p>We are royalty.</p>
<p>We must live as royalty.</p>
<p>The purpose of a monarchy is to lift the
nation.</p>
<p>We are called to lift others with the life
and love of Jesus.</p>
<p><b>Summary:</b>Semnos refers to
the character of a Christian leader.</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> A
Christian leader must present the right image.</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> It is the character of an ambassador - a representative.</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> The exemplary character of semnos.</p>
<p><strong>4)</strong> The character ofroyalty whose
words are always fulfilled.</p>
