<p><b>Lesson Title:Patience (Hupomone)</b></p>
Romans 5:3'And not only so, but we glory in
tribulations also: knowing that tribulation works patience (Greek: hupomone);'</p>
<p><b>Introduction:</b><span><b>Meaning of 'hupomone'
patience.</b></span></p>
<p>Patience
'hupomone' comes from two root Greek words - 'hupo' meaning under, and 'mone'
meaning abiding, remaining steadfast.</p>
<p>Patience
is remaining steadfast under trial.</p>
<p><b>Shipwrecked lives - </b>Lacking patience.</p>
<p>Tribulation
will reveal the true character.</p>
<p><b>Patience is one of the characteristics for a
fruitful Christian life.</b></p>
<p><span>2 Peter 1:5-8'And beside this,
giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;And to knowledge temperance; and to
temperance patience; and to patience godliness;And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness
charity.For if these things be in you,
and abound, they make <i>you that ye shall</i> neither <i>be</i> barren nor
unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.'</span></p>
<p><span class="GramE"><b>giving</b></span> (pareisferw) - para means 'beside'; 'eis' means
'into' and 'phero' means 'to bring'.It means 'along with this (the promises of
God that makes us partakers of His nature) bring...'<b></b></p>
<p><span class="GramE"><b>diligence</b></span> (spoudhn) -giving
oneself totally to the task.Zealous with haste.A
diligent person will pursue the goal with fervent zeal.<b></b></p>
<p><span class="GramE"><b>add</b></span> (epicorhghsate) -
'epi' is a preposition and has the meaning of being
'over' or 'upon' and 'choregeo' meaning 'to minister
with abundance'.<b></b></p>
<p><b>Faith (</b>pistei)<b> - </b>firm persuasion based upon the character of God and the
fulfillment of His word.</p>
<p><span class="GramE"><b>virtue</b></span><b> (</b>areth) -moral excellence (living life by the highest standard
of uprightness)</p>
<p><span class="GramE"><b>knowledge</b></span><b> (</b>gnwsin) - Subjective (experiential) and objective knowledge -
subjectively through relationship; objectively through the scriptures.</p>
<p><span class="GramE"><b>temperance</b></span><b> (</b>egkrateian)<b> - </b>appetites and
desires under the control of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><span class="GramE"><b>patience</b></span><b> (</b>upomonhn) - remaining steadfast under trials.</p>
<p><span class="GramE"><b>godliness</b></span><b> (</b>eusebeian) -a godly
lifestyle, devout, always seeking to do that which pleases the Lord.</p>
<p><span class="GramE"><b>brotherly</b></span><b> kindness (</b>filadelfian)<b> - </b><span>love as brothers<b></b></span></p>
<p><span class="GramE"><b>love</b></span> (agaphn) -divine
love<b></b></p>
<p><b>Introductory Story:Steadfast in the face of great trial.</b></p>
<p>I went
to Romania on ten occasions with Thorkil
from Denmark.Thorkil was the Danish leader of 'Rescue', a Romanian
prison ministry.In January 2009, Thorkil died.</p>
<p>Thorkil faced great
trials in his life.But his
steadfastness in the face of these trials produced fruitful ministry.When I thought about Thorkil's
life I saw that his ministry had three main characteristics. </p>
<p>Thorkil's
ministry to the prisoners: </p>
<ol>
<li>He
     had an unstoppable determination </li>
<li>He
     loved with the love of Jesus</li>
<li>He
     spoke as a King for he always kept his word.</li>
</ol>
<p><span><a href="/btp/message/greekwords/greekweb/thorkil.htm">I gave this short testimony at Thorkil's funeral.</a></span></p>
<p>These
three characteristics should be the hallmark of every Christian.</p>
<p>Christians
should be known for having an enduring character.</p>
<p>When we are
stopped by trials and difficulties, it is because we have not zealously sought
to minister with patience 'hupomeno'.</p>
<p>It is only
the Holy Spirit who can give the power to endure under trial.</p>
<p>1
Corinthians 15:58'Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as you know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.'</p>
<h2>Main Points</h2>
<h3>1. Patiently enduring with joy.</h3>
<p>Colossians 1:11 'Strengthened with all might,
according to his glorious power, unto all patience (hupomeno)
and longsuffering (makrothumia) with joyfulness;'</p>
<p><b>Paul prayer for the Colossians </b></p>
<p>Colossians 1:9-11</p>
<p>Filled with knowledge and understandingKNOW THE SCRIPTURES</p>
<p>Walk worthy in fruitfulnessWALK
IN THE SPIRIT</p>
<p>Increasing in knowledgeEXPERIENTIAL KNOWLEDGE</p>
<p>Paul
prays that the Colossian believers will be 'strengthened (dunamoo)
with all might (dunamus), according to His glorious
power (kratos), unto all patience (hupomeno)
and longsuffering (makrothumia) with joyfulness;'</p>
<p><b>Difference between
Patience and Longsuffering</b></p>
<p>Patience is the strength to endure - remaining firm in the face of great
difficulty </p>
<p>Longsuffering refers to the strength to restrain - Longsuffering is
being slow to anger, and never seeks to retaliate.<b></b></p>
<p><b>Joyfulness</b></p>
<p>The life
of Christ in the believer produces joy.</p>
<p>Patience
produces steadfast joy</p>
<p>Longsuffering
produces joy in thankfulness - looks to the promise of an inheritance (1:12).</p>
<p><b>INHERITANCE</b></p>
<p>All my
life I have lived in rented accommodation.</p>
<p>I have
been involved in ministry most of my working life and my income has been small.</p>
<p>But I
have always known that one day my brother and I will one day inherit my
parent's house.</p>
<p>The will
is written and authorized and one day it will come into effect.</p>
<p>I do not
need to receive the inheritance but knowing it is there gives me patience to
endure difficult times now.</p>
<p>Joyfulness
in knowing the trial is only while we wait for our inheritance.</p>
<h3>2. Patiently enduring temptation</h3>

<p>James
1:3:4, 'Knowing this, that the trying of your faith works patience.But let patience have her perfect work, that
you may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.'</p>
<p>James 1:12, 'Blessed is the man that endures
(hupomeno) temptation: for when he is tried, he shall
receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.'</p>
<p><span class="GramE"><b>A time of
testing.</b></span><b></b></p>
<p>The
reality of our faith is being tested.</p>
<p>Temptation (Gr. peirasmos)
meaning 'trial or proving'.A time of proving to see
the reality of our faith.</p>
<p><b>God puts limits on the temptation.</b></p>
<p>The test
will be restricted by what we are able to carry.</p>
<p>1
Corinthians 10:13, 'There has no temptation taken you but such as is common to
man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye
are able to resist; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape,
that ye may be able to bear it.'</p>
<p><b>Christians often ask the question, why did
God allow my family member to die?</b></p>
<p>There is
no easy answer to this question.</p>
<p>But
there are many things we do not understand.</p>
<p>The
question is based on the idea that God is in control of everything.</p>
<p>But God
is not in control of everything.</p>
<p>There is
a spiritual warfare going on.</p>
<p>Events
happen contrary to the will of God.</p>
<p><b>But God is in control of that which He does
not control.</b></p>
<p>I try to
explain it like this:</p>
<p>Draw a
line to show events happen which God did not control.</p>
<p>Draw a
circle around the line to show God is in control.</p>
<p>In other
words:</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> What God controls is
determined but </p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> That which He does not
control is not determined.</p>
<p>Prayer
is asking God to intervene in that which He does not automatically control.</p>
<p>Is it
necessary to pray for what is determined?No - we thank Him for it.</p>
<p>Is it
necessary to pray for what is not determined?Yes at all times with thanksgiving because the Lord operates in response
to prayer.</p>
<p><b>Why does God not just do it anyway?</b></p>
<p>The kingdom
of darkness has been given power in this world</p>
<p>This is
part of the eternal plan and purpose of God.</p>
<p>We have
been given power over it but we must move in this power.</p>
<p>But this
does not mean Christians have power to avoid suffering</p>
<p>Sickness
and death afflict the righteous and the unrighteous.</p>
<h3>3. Love will patiently endure. </h3>
<p><span>1
Corinthians 13:7<b></b></span></p>
<p>The love
of Christ in the believer will patiently endure all things.</p>
<p>Agape
love does not have self interest.</p>
<p>Anger
arises when the self life is attacked.</p>
<p>But agape
love rests in Christ and has no interest in self.</p>
<p><span class="GramE"><b>In ministry.</b></span><b></b></p>
<p>If we
are seeking the respect and honour (financially or
otherwise) from people or organizations then we will become angry when we are
rejected or ignored.</p>
<p>Agape
love will seek to do the will of the Lord without regard to others.</p>
<p>If we
look for the help of others to fulfil our ministries
then we will not do what the Lord wants us to do. </p>
<p>Love
will patiently endure regardless of the difficulties.</p>
<p><span class="GramE"><b>In families.</b></span><b></b></p>
<p>Patient
endurance needs to be seen in Christian families.</p>
<p>The
family will be steadfast.</p>
<p>Children
will feel secure.</p>
<p>The
family will prosper - even if times are hard ultimately true prosperity will
come.</p>
<p><b>Family discord is destructive and can damage
the children psychologically. </b></p>
<p>Visited a Christian family with marriage problems.</p>
<p>They
regarded one another as the problem but the real problem was the lack of love
patently enduring.</p>
<p>Love
endures all things.Does not feel
threatened when the 'self life' is attacked.</p>
<p>Those
who are closest to us can hurt us the most.</p>
<p>But love
patiently enduring is able to withstand the most painful assaults on our 'self
life'.</p>
<p>Much is
said today about 'self esteem', but the self esteem of a Christian should be
'in Christ' and not 'in self'.</p>
<p>I esteem
myself in 'who He is' and not in 'who I am'.</p>
<p>'On
Christ the solid rock I stand all other ground is sinking sand'.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Patience is not a fruit of the Spirit but the fruit of the
Spirit will hang from this branch.</p>
<ol>
<li>Patently
     enduring with joy - we have an inheritance waiting us in Christ.</li>
<li>Patiently
     enduring temptation - knowing that God is in control of that which He does
     not control.</li>
<li>Love
     will patiently endure - esteeming myself in 'who He is' not 'who I am'.</li>
</ol>
