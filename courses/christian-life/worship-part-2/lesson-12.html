And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: <i>it is</i> hard for thee to kick against the pricks."</span></span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"&gt; The anointed worshipper is one who glorifies the Lord in the face of persecution from those who resist the moving of the Holy Spirit.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Exposition:</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>1.</strong> The prayers of anointed worshippers change persecutors into worshippers. <span class="italic text-gray-600">"Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;"</span><span> (Matthew 5:44)</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"&gt; Prayer on this level of worship has great power with God because the love of Christ in the worshipper is expressed through his or her concern for the welfare of others.<span> Stephen prayed for his attackers to be forgiven when he was being stoned to death, he cried out with a loud voice,</span>"</span>Lord, lay not this sin to their charge<span class="italic text-gray-600">" (Acts 7:60).</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>&gt; Prayers offered in worship on behalf of those who resist the moving of the Holy Spirit will turn persecutors like Saul into worshippers. The prayers of the early church were united with the eternal plan and purpose of God, and Saul of Tarsus was turned from being a murderous persecutor of the believers into one who was willing to count everything as rubbish that he might win Christ.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>2.</strong> The early church was persecuted by those who resisted the moving of the Holy Spirit.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>&gt; The anointing brought humiliation to the Apostles and the threat of death.<span> They were persecuted because the Jewish leaders had been <span class="italic text-gray-600">"cut to the heart"</span> by the anointing of the Holy Spirit.</span><span class="italic text-gray-600">"When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay them."</span><span> (Acts</span><st1:time hour="5" minute="33">5:33</st1:time>)</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"&gt; The disciples rejoiced when they were beaten and disgraced in front of highly respected Jewish leaders. "</span>...and when they had called the apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.<span> And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name. And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.<span class="italic text-gray-600">" (Acts 5:40-42)</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>&gt; Persecuting the church is the same as persecuting Christ.<span> When the religious leaders persecuted the believers in Christ they were persecuting Christ,</span><span class="italic text-gray-600">"why are you persecuting me?<span> And he said, Who are You, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom you are persecuting: it is hard for you to kick against the pricks."</span> (Acts 9:4-5)</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"&gt; When the Lord told Saul, "</span>it is hard for you to kick against the pricks<span class="italic text-gray-600">", He was referring to how Paul was resisting the moving of the Holy Spirit.<span> Saul had been "</span>cut to the heart<span class="italic text-gray-600">" by the testimony of Stephen and the other believers, but because of his hardness of heart, he was not willing to recognise that Jesus is the Messiah. He was seeking to persecute the church even at the time of his encounter with the Lord on the</span><st1:street><st1:address>Damascus Road</st1:address></st1:street>.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>3.</strong> Paul knew from his conversion that he would worship on this level.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"&gt; The Lord revealed to Paul that he would worship at this level.<span> When Ananias was told to pray for Saul after his</span><st1:street><st1:address>Damascus Road</st1:address></st1:street> conversion, the Lord revealed the "</span>great things he must suffer for my names sake<span class="italic text-gray-600">"<span> (Acts</span><st1:time hour="9" minute="16">9:16</st1:time>).<span> Ananias was sent to lay hands on Saul so that he would be "</span>filled with the Holy Spirit<span class="italic text-gray-600">". The one who had persecuted the church because of the anointing was now himself anointed for ministry and that anointing would bring him into opposition with those who would resist the moving of the Holy Spirit. The persecutor who resisted the Holy Spirit would become the persecuted because of the anointing. In order to fulfil this ministry the first thing Paul had to learn was to worship.</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>&gt; The anointing of the Holy Spirit enabled Paul to worship on the highest levels.<span> His primary calling was always to be a worshipper. His ministry developed out of worship. Paul never sought to build up his ministry, but he always sought to move higher in worship. For Paul it made no difference whether he was in prison, out of prison, in need, or in abundance. Paul wanted to fulfil his ministry with joy. This was not just the joy of fulfilment and the satisfaction of having done well; it was the joy that is necessary for worship.</span><span class="italic text-gray-600">"But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God."</span><span> (Acts</span><st1:time hour="20" minute="24">20:24</st1:time>)</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"&gt; First and foremost Paul was a worshipper.<span> He wrote from prison to the Philippians that he counted all things as rubbish that he might gain Christ. Paul had no concern for his own interests or safety, but he rejoiced in his sufferings because he was a worshipper, and he rejoiced in the opportunity to express his love for his Lord.</span>"</span>That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death; If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.<span class="italic text-gray-600">" (Philippians 3:10-11)</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>&gt; The fellowship of His sufferings does not mean the sufferings of the Lord on the cross because the Lord bore this suffering alone when He cried <span class="italic text-gray-600">"it is finished"</span> (John <st1:time hour="19" minute="30">19:30</st1:time>).<span> It means being a fellow participator of His sufferings from those who resist the moving of the Holy Spirit. Paul wrote to the Colossians that he rejoiced in his sufferings and being afflicted in his ministry to the body of Christ.</span><span class="italic text-gray-600">"Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his bodys sake, which is the church:"</span> (Colossians <st1:time hour="1" minute="24">1:24</st1:time>)</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"&gt; Paul worshipped at the highest levels of worship, but he still wrote "</span>that I might know Him<span class="italic text-gray-600">".<span> There are always greater heights to reach in worshipping the Lord. Even though Paul had worshipped in heaven, he still desired to move higher in worship.</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>4.</strong> A worshipper rejoices in being persecuted for Christ.<span> It is important to understand that being persecuted is not worship. Paul wrote that suffering persecution will only bring a reward if we have love.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"&gt; A worshipper rejoices in persecution because of his or her love for Christ. "</span>And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not love, it profits me nothing.<span class="italic text-gray-600">"<span> (1 Corinthians 13:3)</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>&gt; Some people are persecuted because they have been deliberately confrontational.<span> They have provoked people into reacting against them. This is not worship. They are being persecuted because they have been deliberately aggressive towards others who disagree. Even though they are saved and belong to Christ, they are not worshippers; they are contentious. Worship in persecution is humble submission to the will of God and rejoicing at the privilege of suffering shame for what the Lord has done.</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"&gt; Jesus told His disciples to rejoice in persecution because they would receive a great reward. When we are spoken against falsely for His name's sake, we should never try to defend ourselves, we should rejoice.<span> We should always keep in mind the day when we will see Jesus. John Wesley called persecution the badge of discipleship. Rejoicing in persecution is the characteristic of the worshipper.</span><span class="italic text-gray-600">"Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you."</span><span> (Matthew 5:10-12)</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Conclusion:</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>1.</strong> We must never regard anyone as too bad to become a worshipper.<span> The prayers of anointed worshippers can change persecutors into worshippers.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>2.</strong> Persecution from those who resist the moving of the Holy Spirit provides opportunity to worship.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>3.</strong> Paul was a worshipper and his ministry was built on worship.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>4.</strong> We are to rejoice in persecution knowing that we will receive a great reward in heaven.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>What should the student do?</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>1)</strong> Pray for those who persecute us.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>2)</strong> Worship in persecution</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>3)</strong> Seek to fulfil our ministry with joy.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>4)</strong> Rejoice that we will receive an eternal reward.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b><a href="lesson-12.html">Lesson Outline<span></span></a></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b><a href="/courses/christian-life/worship/part-2.html">Course Index</a></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p>
