For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature."</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Introduction:</b>The message of the book of Galatians.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"> The Galatian believers had been led away from the gospel that Paul preached into the teaching of the Judaisers who taught that salvation was by faith in Christ and by keeping the law.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Teaching of the Judaisers - salvation is by faith + the law.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Paul condemned this teaching (Galatians 1:8-9).</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>> What was the gospel Paul preached?<span> It was the gospel of the cross</span>(Galatians <st1:time hour="6" minute="14">6:14</st1:time>). The gospel of the cross is that salvation is by faith in Christ alone.<span> That Jesus died in our place (substitutionary atonement) so that through His death we are freed from our sin and the condemnation of the law; through His resurrection we are raised to new life in Him; through His ascension we seated in heavenly places in Him.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Introductory<span> Story:</span></b>Personal Testimony<b> </b><span><span>Stand Fast</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Exposition:</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>1.</strong> New life in Christ Becoming a new creation.<span> The cross puts an end to the old man.</span>Galatians 2:20 <span>"</span>I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.<span class="italic text-gray-600">"</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>> Keeping the law does not change the heart.<span> A person can keep the law outwardly and be inwardly corrupt. Jesus taught his disciples that the outward righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees was not acceptable to God.</span>Matthew 5:20<span> <span class="italic text-gray-600">"For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven."</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"> Holiness concerns the heart.<span> We must not only be holy in outward actions we must be holy in our thoughts and desires.</span>Matthew 5:<span>27-28<span> "</span>You have heard that it was said by them of old time, you shall not commit adultery: But I say unto you, That whosoever looks on a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.<span class="italic text-gray-600">"</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>> When Moses records the giving of the law in the book of Deuteronomy, he also records the words of the Lord to him at that time.<span> Deuteronomy 5:29 <span class="italic text-gray-600">"O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever!"</span> The Lord longed for the day when the hearts of His people would be changed so that they would always be holy.<span> He desires His people to be blessed.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">When I was teaching at Bible school in <st1:place><st1:city>Peterhead</st1:city>, <st1:country-region>Scotland</st1:country-region></st1:place> in 1980,<span> the principal of</span><st1:place><st1:placename>Lee</st1:placename> <st1:placename>College</st1:placename></st1:place> in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>USA</st1:place></st1:country-region>, Dr. Charles Conn, came to teach.<span> He explained the liberty of Christ by telling us that at Lee College the students were told that for those who wanted to attend the morning devotion, it was voluntary, but for those who did not want to attend, it was compulsory.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">This is the difference between the Old and New Covenant.<span> Those who wanted to attend the devotion came willingly and cheerfully, but those who did not want to attend were forced to attend.<br/>There is no need for the law when the heart seeks after holiness.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>2.</strong> Standing in the new life the liberty of Christ.Galatians 5:1 "</span>Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.<span class="italic text-gray-600">"</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>> The liberty of Christ stands in contrast to the bondage of the law.<span> The liberty of Christ is the freedom in Christ to be holy. It is not the freedom to sin - that is not freedom it is bondage. The believer in Christ is not under the Old Testament law that is bondage, he or she is under the law of Christ that is freedom. The law of Christ is the life of Christ in control in the life of the believer</span>(Colossians 3:1-4).</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"> The liberty of Christ stands in contrast to legalism and moralism.<span> Many Christians are legalistic but this is not Christianity. The liberty of Christ is the freedom to be who we are. If anyone is in Christ he or she becomes a new creation</span>(2 Corinthians 5:17) - the believer in Christ must learn to let the new life be in control of his or her life.<span> This means to walk in the Spirit. The fear of falling produces a desire for something to hold on to (the law), but New Testament Christianity is the message that Christ lives in the believer (new life).</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>3.</strong> Walking in new life - the fruit of new life.Galatians <st1:time hour="5" minute="16">5:16</st1:time><span> <span class="italic text-gray-600">"This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh."</span> Holiness is the product of the believer walking in the Spirit.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"> The fruit of the Spirit comes through the growth of the life of Christ in the believer.Galatians 5:22-23.Paul contrasts the fruit of the Spirit with the works of the flesh.<span> The law does not produce fruit only the life of Christ in us can produce fruit.</span>Galatians 5:19-21.<span> When we produce the fruit of the Spirit we obey the law without being under the law.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>> The fruit of holiness is fulfilled by love.Galatians 5:14<span> <span class="italic text-gray-600">"For all the law is fulfilled in one word, <i>even</i> in this; You shall love your neighbour as yourself."</span> The characteristic of the disciples of Christ is love.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Summary:</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Paul gloried in the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>1)</strong> The believer is a new creation in Christ.<span> The believer is raised in newness of life in Christ.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>2)</strong> The believer is dead to the law and must stand in the liberty of Christ.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>3)</span>The believer is free from the demands of the law and has freedom in Christ.<span> We must walk in the Spirit and bring forth the fruit of holiness.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b><a href="http://www.bibleteachingprogram.com/cfcross.html"><span>Course Index</a></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Back to <b><span><a href="http://www.bibleteachingprogram.com/"><span>Bible Teaching Program</a></b></p>
