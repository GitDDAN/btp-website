The Word of Knowledge concerning her private life opened the woman's eyes to see that Jesus was the Messiah, John 4:29.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Similarities between the ministry of Jesus and the ministry of Elisha.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The ministry of Jesus had similarities to other ministries in the Old Testament.<span> This is because Jesus ministered in the power of the Holy Spirit. For instance: 2 Kings 4:42-44, Elisha</span> fed a hundred men with twenty loaves of barley. John 6:5-13, Jesus fed five thousand with five barley loaves and two fish.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Summary:</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>1"&gt; <span dir="LTR">Jesus ministered in the power of the Holy Spirit not in His inherent power as the Son of God.</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>2&gt; <span dir="LTR">Jesus could not have told the disciples that they would do greater works if he had not ministered in the power of the Holy Spirit.</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>3</span><span dir="LTR">The Gifts of the Holy Spirit are evident in the ministry of Jesus and the purpose of the gifts was to show that Jesus is the Messiah.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p>
