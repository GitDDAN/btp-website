They could only know who Jesus is if their eyes were opened by the Holy Spirit.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>a)</strong> Caesarea Philipi. In the place named after earthly rulers (Philip the tetrarch and Caesar) Jesus asked them if they recognised who He is.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Matthew 16:13-18 <span><span class="italic text-gray-600">"When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?<span> And they said, Some <i>say that thou art</i> John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias</span>, or one of the prophets. He saith</span> unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona</span>: for flesh and blood hath not revealed <i>it</i> unto thee, but my Father, which is in heaven. And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter (petros), and upon this rock (petra) I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it."</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>b)</strong> The Foundation of the Church is "Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the Living God<span class="italic text-gray-600">".</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The foundation is not Peter - "Peter<span class="italic text-gray-600">" (Greek: petros meaning a stone); the rock (petra</span> meaning a rock or large stone) is Christ,</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">1 Corinthians 3:11 "For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.<span class="italic text-gray-600">" The Church stands on the foundation that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God.<span> See also 1 Corinthians 10:4.</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">"The Christ<span class="italic text-gray-600">" meaning "</span>the anointed one<span class="italic text-gray-600">" - His ministry, Isaiah 61:1-2</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The Son of the Living God - His person.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">To be a witness to the Lord Jesus Christ requires that our lives be built upon the foundation of Jesus Christ.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>2.</strong> The church bears witness to who Jesus in the power of the Holy Spirit.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>a)</strong> The baptism with the Holy Spirit empowers the church to be the witnesses of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Acts 1:8<span><span> "</span>But you shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in</span>Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.<span class="italic text-gray-600">"</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The promise of the Holy Spirit baptism is given to "all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call<span class="italic text-gray-600">", Acts 2:38-39.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">This includes the body of Christ today.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>b)</strong> The baptism with the Holy Spirit provides boldness to bear witness to the Lord Jesus Christ in the face of persecution.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Acts 5:32<span> <span class="italic text-gray-600">"And we are his witnesses of these things;

and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.<span class="italic text-gray-600">"</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The world should experience the love and life of Jesus through the body of Christ, As He is, so are we in this world, 1 John 4:17.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Summary:</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">To be a witness to who Jesus is:</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>1)</strong> We must know Him through a personal relationship.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>2)</strong> We must be baptised with the Holy Spirit.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>3)</strong> We must be like Him.
