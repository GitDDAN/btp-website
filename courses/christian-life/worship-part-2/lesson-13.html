rejoices in God<span class="italic text-gray-600">'s plan to build a temple for worship.<span> When the Son of God became man, worship was lifted to a new realm. For not only was the Son of God the object of worship, He as man worshipped the Father. The eternal Son of God became a worshipper so that He could redeem a people for worship. Jesus died on the cross worshipping the Father for He knew He was fulfilling the eternal plan and purpose of God.</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>"Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.<span class="italic text-gray-600">"</span></b><b> (Hebrews 12:2).</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The joy that was set before Him was the joy ofpresenting worshippers to the Father.<span> His body was the</span><st1:place><st1:placetype>temple</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>God</st1:placename></st1:place> and through His death and resurrection, a great multitude would become a part of the body of Christ.</p> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2"><b>Paul worshipped in prison because his suffering was fulfilling the eternal plan and purpose God</b></h3> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Paul saw this as he wrote to the Ephesian believers from prison.<span> He saw that his ministry was in fulfilment of the purpose of God to build a dwelling place for His glory to dwell in; a place of worship; a temple consisting of Jews and Gentiles (Ephesians</span><st1:time hour="2" minute="19">2:19</st1:time>-22).<span> He became enraptured as he wrote because he saw the wonderful plan and purpose of God. He was lifted from the level of suffering shame as a prisoner for Christ to the height of seeing that in the eternal purpose of God he was the prisoner of the Lord.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>"For this reason I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ, for you Gentiles<span class="italic text-gray-600">"<span> (Ephesians 3:1).</span></span></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">He was not a prisoner of <st1:city><st1:place>Rome</st1:place></st1:city>; he was a worshipper of Christ.<span> This is what is marvellous about the epistles of the New Testament. They are not literary expertise; they are the writings of worshippers who are inspired of the Holy Spirit. Paul worshipped in delight at the unsearchable riches of Christ"</span> (Ephesians 3:8), knowing that he was united with Christ in building a people for worship.</p> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2"><b>Every person in the body of Christ is needed to fulfil the Great Commission.</b></h3> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">God is still fulfilling His purpose through the weak and foolish things.<span> The plan and purpose of God in the Great Commission involves the whole body of Christ. <span class="italic text-gray-600">"God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise"</span>, (1 Corinthians</span><st1:time hour="1" minute="27">1:27</st1:time>).<span> Some Christians have the perception that the evangelisation of the world is being done through big evangelists and all we have to do is to support them. Thank God for evangelists. Philip was an evangelist who saw God move mightily in</span><st1:city><st1:place>Samaria</st1:place></st1:city> and there was great joy in that city, (Acts 8:8).<span> But it was not just Philip; all the believers that were scattered went everywhere talking about Jesus (Acts 8:4). The church does not need new evangelistic methods to win people to Christ. Believers who fulfil the high calling to worship will overflow with joy in the Holy Spirit, and talk about the Saviour they love. This will bring multitudes to Christ. Young and old people need to know the joy of the Holy Spirit. When we understand this then we will realise that being insignificant is normal and we have a great calling to fulfil with joy in God<span class="italic text-gray-600">'s eternal plan and purpose.</span></span></p> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2"><b>3)<span> This level of worship is the place of intercession.</span></b></h3> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The worshipper has a relationship with the Lord from where he or she can be lead from worship to intercession.<span> This is exactly what happened with Moses when he asked the Lord "</span>show me your glory<span class="italic text-gray-600">", (Exodus 33:18). Moses wanted to "</span>know the Lord<span class="italic text-gray-600">" (Exodus 33:13), and the Lord let His glory pass by him (Exodus 33:19-23). Once Moses had encountered the glory of God, he worshipped. But he did not stop there. He began to intercede on behalf of the children of</span><st1:country-region><st1:place>Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>"And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped.<span> And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord, let my Lord, I pray You, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your inheritance.<span class="italic text-gray-600">" (Exodus 34:8-9)</span></span></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Worship brings us into a close relationship with the Lord so that intercession becomes a natural progression from worship on the highest level.<span> We should always be ready to use our relationship with the Lord to begin interceding on behalf of others. The Greek word translated intercessions <i>(enteuxis)</i> in 1 Timothy 2:1 is the word used for approaching a King. An intercessor is one who through worship maintains a close relationship with the Lord and through this relationship is able to approach God on the behalf of another.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>"I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;<span class="italic text-gray-600">"<span> (1 Timothy 2:1)</span></span></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Everything Paul did flowed out of worship.<span> It was therefore natural that Paul had the heart of an intercessor. Paul's heart burned for his fellow countrymen. He longed for</span><st1:country-region><st1:place>Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region> to be saved.<span> An intercessor is willing to risk everything for another. If it had been possible Paul was willing to be accursed for his countrymen. This is the heart of Jesus. Only the Lord was able to be accursed for us. When we worship we become like Him in our character. Paul wrote:</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b><span class="italic text-gray-600">"I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Spirit,<span> that I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart. For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:"</span> (Romans 9:1-3)</span></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The person who has a special ministry in intercessory prayer is firstly a worshipper on the highest level.<span> The anointed worshipper who rejoices in the glory of God will naturally become an intercessor.</span></p> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2"><b>God makes rebels into mighty worshippers.</b></h3> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Jesus revealed the wonderful truth that the Father is seeking worshippers to a Samaritan woman at Jacob<span class="italic text-gray-600">'s well. There is significance in this because scripture identifies Jacob as a worshipper. In the book of Hebrews, Jacob is shown to have worshipped at the end of his life:</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>"By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff.<span class="italic text-gray-600">" (Hebrews 11:21)</span></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The significance of Jacob leaning upon his staff is that he was weak in the flesh.<span> It reminds us of how he was weakened when he wrestled with the Lord, and went away limping. Jacob was a natural deceiver who could gain what he wanted by craftiness. From his youth, Jacob desired the blessing of God, and he sought to gain even this by his own craftiness. The Lord loved him despite all his faults and saw in him the potential of a worshipper, but the Lord had to deal with his craftiness in order to lead him to the heights of worship.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Having a heart for God was not enough, Jacob had to become weak in his own strength in order to become mighty in worship.<span> The Lord was with Jacob, leading him, teaching him, breaking him, and Jacob was learning to know the Lord. The heights of worship can only be reached through brokenness. Jacob's testimony at the end of his life was that his days were <span class="italic text-gray-600">"evil"</span> meaning sad and unpleasant. The joy of worship flowed out from his broken spirit.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b><span class="italic text-gray-600">"And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of my life been,"</span> (Genesis 47:9)</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Jacob experienced great sorrow when he suffered the loss of the wife he loved, and then the loss of his favourite son.<span> This was the only way that Jacob could be led to the heights of worship. When he reached the end of his life the beauty of his relationship with the Lord is revealed as he worships on the highest level prophesying concerning the eternal plan and purpose of God. Jacobs life is an example of how the Lord leads us higher in worship when we have a desire to seek after Him. The reason the Lord leads us the way He does is because the Father is seeking worshippers. God has led you this way to bring you to the heights of worship.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The anointing at this level lifts the worship from earth to heaven.<span> The worshipper not only rejoices in being counted worthy to suffer shame for the name of Jesus, but sees beyond this into the eternal plan and purpose of God, which was prepared even before the creation of the world. There is great rejoicing in every situation because the anointing of the Holy Spirit is in control of every situation and circumstance.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Although this is the highest place of worship within this level of worship there will always be greater heights to reach.<span> The height of His glory is infinite. Worship on this level will always produce intercessory prayer, because intercession is born out of a close relationship with the Lord. Intercessory worshippers are characterised by a complete lack of self-interest; the desire to seek the glory of God; and a heart that burns with love for the eternal welfare of others.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><a href="/courses/christian-life/worship/part-2.html"><span>Course Index</span></a></p>
