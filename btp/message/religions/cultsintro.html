<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-GB">Introductory Lesson (5): </span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-GB">Lesson Title: The Gravitational Pull of the Old Testament.</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-GB">Theme</span></b><span lang="EN-GB">:
Beware that zeal doesn't lead to Old Testament bondage. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-GB">Introduction</span></b><span lang="EN-GB">:<span> The
gravitational pull of the Old Testament</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">

Carnal thinking will always be drawn back to
the Old Testament like a magnet. There
is only one antidote for 'false teaching' preach the cross. Not glorying in leaders or genealogy, not
glorying in knowledge, and not glorying in our church; but rather glorying in
the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ that has left us with nothing else to glory
in but Christ crucified.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">If we move away from the cross we will be drawn
back into bondage.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Cults and Heresies that call themselves Christian
are usually characterised by their use of Old Testament teaching to oppose New
Testament Christianity.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">For instance: </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><span>1.</span></span><span lang="EN-GB">Seventh Day Adventists use the Old Testament
teaching of the Sabbath to oppose the New Testament teaching that the Sabbath
rest was fulfilled through Christ.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><span>2.</span></span><span lang="EN-GB">Mormons follow a form of Old Testament history
concerning a Promised Land and the building of temples to oppose the New
Testament teaching that God now dwells in the hearts and lives of His people.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><span>3.</span></span><span lang="EN-GB">Roman Catholicism is built upon an Old
Testament form of priesthood offering the sacrifice of the Mass on behalf of
the laity. This contradicts the teaching
of the priesthood of all believers and the once for all sacrifice of </span><span lang="EN-GB">Calvary</span><span lang="EN-GB">. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The people who are in most danger of being drawn
into error are often those who are most zealous for God. They may be more open to deception because
they are aware of the apostasy in the Church. Mormonism and Seventh Day Adventism arose during a time of revival in
which the Second Coming of Christ was strongly emphasised. Their teaching is built upon the belief that
they are the true church and the nominal church is apostate.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-GB">Introductory
Story:Zeal can pull into legalism </span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Some Christians in their zeal to be committed to
Christ have been led into a teaching that the bride of Christ is only an elite
few within the body of Christ.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">They teach that to be in the bride a person must
have a higher standard of obedience.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It is a teaching associated with William Branham
(1909-1965).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The women are taught to only wear long skirts, and
have long hair; some do not cut their hair at all.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Baptism in water is regarded as invalid if the
words 'in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost' are spoken instead of 'in
the name of Jesus'.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">This teaching has
the effect of isolating those who adhere to it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Those within the group usually associate this
isolation with the cost of being zealous disciples of Christ, but in their zeal
to live for Christ they have been drawn back to a legalistic form of
religion.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Galatians
5:<span>13-14 states'For, brethren, you have been called unto
liberty; only <i>use</i> not liberty for an
occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another. For all the law is
fulfilled in one word, <i>even</i> in this;
You shall love your neighbour as yourself.'</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">True Christianity is not the way we dress or wear our hair; it is not the music we listen to or the food we eat; it is not keeping rules and laws; but it is the life of Christ in us (<span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref">Colossians 1:27</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>).

The body of Christ can only glory in the cross.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-GB">Main Points:</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-GB"><span>1.</span></span></b><b><span lang="EN-GB">Glorying
in the flesh instead of the cross</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A characteristic of cults is that they glory in a
leader or an organisation. Glorying in leaders is carnality.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">1
Corinthians 3:<span>3-6 'For you are yet carnal: for whereas there is
among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are you not carnal, and walk as
men? For while one says, I am of Paul;
and another, I am of Apollos; are you not carnal? Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but
ministers by whom you believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?I have planted, Apollos watered; but God
gave the increase.' </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Mormons follow the teaching of Joseph Smith
(1805-1844), Seventh Day Adventists follow Ellen G White (1827-1915).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Following leaders can have terrifying consequences
as was seen when a charismatic preacher Jim Jones (1931-1978) died with almost
1000 of his followers in the Jonestown Massacre in </span><span lang="EN-GB">Guyana</span><span lang="EN-GB"> (Nov.
18, 1978).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The Jews gloried in their lineage. They were the children of Abraham.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The Pharisees were proud that they were the
descendants of Abraham.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">John </span><span lang="EN-GB">8:39</span><span lang="EN-GB">'They answered and said unto him, Abraham is
our father. Jesus said unto them, If you were Abrahams children, you would do
the works of Abraham.'</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">We are not to glory in leaders or in being
descendants of great leaders. All are
one in Christ Jesus. Glorying in leaders or race has no place in the body of
Christ.</span></p>

Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek,
there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for you are
all one in Christ Jesus. And if you <i>be</i> Christs, then are you Abrahams
seed, and heirs according to the promise.'</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">British Israel - teaches that Anglo Saxons are the

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">These organisations then had a natural tendency to

it is who she or he is.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">There is one body of Christ and we are not to
divide ourselves around leaders or organisations. People enjoy different kinds of meetings but
this should not stop us from having fellowship with the body of Christ. The
