<p><b>Lesson Eight</b></p>

Ephesians 6:16
The importance of standing firm with the Shield of Faith. 
<p><b>Details concerning the Shield:</b></p>
<p>Two kinds of
Roman Shield - One shape was circular or oval, but that used by the Roman
legionary was oblong and curved into a half cylinder to protect the body.</p>
<p>Oblong shield</p>
<h3>1. Shield measured
1.3 metres (4 feet by 2½ inches)</h3>
<h3>2. Covered the whole
body - neck to knee.</h3>
<h3>3. Made of a double
layer of boards fastened together with glue and linen.</h3>
<h3>4. Outside surface
covered with calfskin bound at the edges with a framework of metal to enable
the shield to withstand sword blows.</h3>
<h3>5. The shield had a
fireproof metal lining.</h3>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The shield is the
first piece of armour that must be taken up by the Christian soldier. </p>
<p>(Ephesians 6:16)</p>
<p><span>We will be an
easy target for the enemy if we do not hold up the shield of faith.The shield of faith does not operate
automatically.<b></b></span></p>
<p><b>Illustration:Tacitus - The
German Soldier's Shield</b></p>
<p>In ancient times a soldier knew he must
always retain his shield. </p>
<p>The Roman historian, Tacitus,
states that during Roman times the Germans held the shield in such high honour
that it was considered the greatest disgrace for a soldier to lose his shield
in battle.</p>
<p>Tacitus<i><span>Germania</span></i> chapter 6.</p>
<p>'Generally speaking, their strength lies in
infantry rather than cavalry.So
foot-soldiers accompany the cavalry into action, their speed of foot being such
that they can easily keep up with the charging horsemen.The best men are chosen from the whole body
of young warriors and placed with the cavalry in front of the main battle
line.The number of these is precisely
fixed: a hundred are drawn from each district, and 'The Hundred' is the name
they bear among their fellow-countrymen.Thus what was originally a mere number has come to be a title of
distinction.The battle-line is made up
of wedge-shaped formulations.To give
ground, provided that you return to the attack, is considered good tactics
rather than cowardice.They bring back
bodies of the fallen even when a battle hangs in the balance.To throw away one's shield is the supreme
disgrace, and the man who has thus dishonoured himself is debarred from
attendance at sacrifice or assembly.Many such survivors from the battlefield have ended their shame by
hanging themselves.'</p>
<h2>Main Points</h2>
<h3>1. We need the Shield of Faith to fight
the 'good fight of faith'</h3>
<p>, 1 Timothy 6:12
'Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto you are
called, and have professed a good profession before many witnesses.'</p>
<p>a)The word good is the
Greek word 'kalos' this word describes something that
is precious because of its own quality and beauty.The fight of faith is precious in the sight of
God.It is precious because God delights
to see faith, <span>Hebrews 11:6a'But without faith <i>it is</i>
impossible to please <i>him</i>:'</span></p>
<p>b)Peter considered the trial of our faith as being more precious than gold.It is a joyful thing to use the shield of
faith in difficult circumstances.1
Peter 1:6 -7 'Wherein you greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be,
you are in heaviness through manifold temptations: That the trial of your
faith, being much more precious than of gold that perishes, though it be tried
with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of
Jesus Christ:'</p>
<p>c)Faith in God and faith in His promises.The good fight of
faith relies entirely upon God - it is faith in His character and faith in His
word.'But without faith it is
impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is,
and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently
seek him.' (Hebrews 11:6.)</p>
<p>When the
enemy attacks we raise the shield of faith that God is the I AM THAT I AM and He will always honour His word.</p>
<p><b>If we are to
rely upon a promise we need to know two things.</b></p>
<p>Is the character
of the person reliable?</p>
<p>What exactly has
been promised?</p>
<p>The Shield of
Faith trusts in:</p>
<p>-    The Character of God: He cannot deny Himself. (2 Timothy 2:13)</p>
<p>-    The Word of God: The promises of God are yes and Amen. (2 Corinthians 1:20)</p>
<p>d)We cannot fight 'the good fight of faith' with worldly
methods. Psychology and professionalism are useless in spiritual warfare.We will be defeated if we cannot tell the
difference between the shield of faith and worldly methods.It is not using these
methods that is wrong, but if we trust in these things to overcome the
enemy in spiritual warfare then we will be defeated.A good soldier does not get entangled in
worldly affairs,2
Timothy 2:<span>4'No man
that wars entangles himself with the affairs of <i>this</i> life; that he may please him who has chosen him to be a
soldier.'</span></p>
<p><b><span>2.The</span></b><b> shields were large and could be linked together to form a wall
against the enemy, and therefore able to protect others as well as the
individual soldier. </b></p>
<p>a)Protecting one another. The shield is for the
individual soldier, but also for use in protecting each other.</p>
<p>Forming a wall of defence. The Roman
shield was part of the armour held by every individual soldier, but the shields
could also be linked together to form a wall against the onslaught of the
enemy.</p>
<p>The defence is
stronger when the body of Christ is joined together.Ecclesiastes 4:12And if one prevail
against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly
broken.Satan seeks to weaken the body of Christ by
causing divisions.Satan seeks to weaken the body
of Christ by promoting a unity that does not uphold the shield of faith.</p>
<p>We must use the
shield to protect one another.We need
to be our brother's keeper when it is necessary and be considerate of one
another in the body of Christ.Romans
15:1 'We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and
not to please ourselves.'We are
strong when we remain united with our shield of faith forming a wall of
defence.It was important that every soldier kept the shield in place.If there were any gaps the whole group was in
danger.</p>
<p><span>b)Meaning of the Greek word for shield 'thureos'.<b></b></span></p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>The Greek word
for shield is 'thureos' which was the word for a
stone sealing the entrance of a cave.(Ephesians
6:16).</p>
<p><i><span>Thureos</span></i><span> comes from <i>thura</i>
meaning door.The large oblong
four-cornered shield resembled a door. The shield of faith is a door of protection
from the enemy and also provides a door of escape through faith in the promises
of God. John 10:7 'I am the door of the
sheep'. </span></p>
<p>The Shield of Faith provides protection
from the enemy and a way of escape.<span>Hebrews 13:6'So that we may
boldly say, The Lord <i>is</i> my helper,
and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.'</span></p>
<p>We can be assured that we can always uphold
the shield of faith because the Lord continuously protects us.God will not allow us to be tempted beyond
our spiritual strength, and he always provides a door of escape. 1 Corinthians
10:13'There has no temptation taken you
but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to
be tempted above that you are able; but will with the temptation also make a
way to escape, that you may be able to bear it.'</p>
<h3>3. The fireproof metal lining was able to
extinguish the fiery darts of the enemy.</h3>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><span class="GramE"><b>The fiery darts of the
wicked one.</b></span><b></b></p>
<p>What are the fiery darts?</p>
<p>'Fire-tipped darts' - when they hit they
burn.</p>
<p>Seeking to cause the most
destruction.</p>
<p>The aim is to stop us.</p>
<p>If we desire the comforts of life, the riches
of the world or the honours of earth then we will not have a shield to stop the
fiery darts. </p>
<p>Hebrews 11 - Abraham turned his back on
earthly comforts because he sought a city whose builder is God.</p>
<p>Moses esteemed the reproach of Christ greater
riches than the riches of Egypt.</p>
<p>Others confessed they were pilgrims and
strangers - sought a better country.<b></b></p>
<p>The fiery darts aim to stop us trusting in
the promises of God.</p>
<p>Fear regarding what might happen will make us
ineffective in Christian warfare.</p>
<p>People are drawn to Christ when they see
believers having great faith in times of distress or danger </p>
<p><b>Illustration: The faith of the Moravians in the storm</b></p>
<p>John andCharles Wesley were brought to faith
in Christ through the preaching of the Moravians.</p>
<p>Their first encounter with the Moravians was
on ship to the American colonies.They
were astounded by their fearlessness in the storm.Death did not concern them because of their
faith in Christ. </p>
<p><b>Personal
Testimony:</b><span>Faith ministry.<b></b></span></p>
<p>When a lot of money is put into a project
usually there is a lot to see.</p>
<p>Large buildings are impressive.But much of the real work that the Lord is
doing is unseen.It takes the Shield of
Faith to do the Lord's will when there is little that we can show to people.</p>
<p>Ministries should always be focussed on
building up the ministries of others.</p>
<p>If we are focussed on our own ministry then we
can become competitive and see other ministries as a threat to our own. <b></b></p>
<p>US
dollar bank notes have the words written on them 'In God we trust'.But many people have the words written upon
their lives 'in money we trust'.The believer in Christ must not be like them.The only door and shield that will enable us
to stand in spiritual warfare is Christ.</p>
<h3>4. The shield of faith will enable the
Christian to be victorious against every attack of the enemy.</h3>
<p><b></b>Romans 8:32 'If God be for us, who can be against us'.</p>
<p>a)The Shield of Faith enables us to withstand the
attacks of the enemy and to be immovable in the Faith. 1 Peter 5:9, 'Resist him steadfast in the Faith'.</p>
<p>Withstanding the attack.1 Peter 5:9a, 'Resist him...'.The Greek word resist is 'anthistemi' which means resist by standing against.In Ephesians 6:13 the same word
is translated 'withstand', 'Wherefore take unto you
the whole armour of God, that you may be able to withstand (anthistemi)
in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.'The Shield enables us to stand when the enemy
throws the fiery darts.</p>
<p>Being immovable.<span> 1 Peter 5:9b, '...
steadfast in the Faith'.The devil runs
when the believer is steadfast (Gr) '<i>stereos</i>' which means 'immovable' in the
Faith. James 4:7, 'resist the devil and he will flee from you'.The devil cannot move the believer provided
he or she takes up the Shield of Faith.</span></p>
<p>b)The Shield of Faith will make us overcomers.1 John 5:4. 'For whatsoever is born of God
overcomes the world: and this is the victory that overcomes the world, even our
faith', 1 John 5:4.</p>
<p>The great overcomers are listed in Hebrews 11.The great characteristic of their lives was
faith.</p>
<p>Abraham '...looked
for a city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God', Hebrews 11:10.The shield of faith enabled Abraham to
overcome the attraction of worldly security to become a pilgrim and a
stranger.</p>
<p>Moses held 'the
reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt:'
Hebrews 11:26. The shield of faith enabled him to overcome the attraction of the
worldly pleasures of Egypt.</p>
<p><span>The shield
of faith enabled the heroes of faith to overcome in the face of great trials
and afflictions.Hebrews 11:35-38 '...and
others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a
better resurrection:And others had
trial of <i>cruel</i> mockings
and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and
imprisonment:They were stoned, they
were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about
in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;(Of whom the world was not worthy:) they
wandered in deserts, and <i>in</i>
mountains, and <i>in</i> dens and caves of
the earth.'</span></p>
<p>c)Faith must be the armour that covers the heart as 'a
breastplate and a shield', 1 Thessalonians 5:8'But
let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and
love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.' Faith
is both a breastplate and a shield. </p>
<p>•The breastplate
covers the heart, which is at the centre of our lives because out of it flows our affections, thoughts and desires.Faith must be in control of our lives.</p>
<p>•The shield
protects us from the fiery darts of the enemy.The Roman shield had a fireproof metal lining that could withstand the
fiery darts of the enemy.When the devil
throws the fiery darts at us then faith must be our shield. </p>
<p>d)Faith must be the shield that enables us to fulfil a
specific work we are called to do.The
devil will throw fiery darts to stop us.These darts can sometimes be thrown by other Christians who do not
understand what we are doing.In these
circumstances we must know that the Lord has led us.</p>
<p><b>Personal
testimony: </b>Obedience to the Lord.</p>
<p>Preparing the Bible Teaching Program has been a great challenge. I have
spent much time writing and preparing.  Christians often admire those who speak to large congregations, but
when someone is doing something without income and that has no immediate results, they do not understand what he or she is doing.
 Words can hurt when times are difficult, but when we know that the Lord has led us to do a specific
work then the shield of faith will quench the fiery darts of the enemy. </p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<h3>1. We must take up
the Shield of Faith so that we can fight the 'good fight of faith'.</h3>
<h3>2. The Shield of
Faith is both a wall and a door. As a
wall it provides protection and as a door it provides a way of escape.</h3>
<h3>3. The Shield of
Faith is able to stop all the fiery darts of the enemy.</h3>
<h3>4. The Shield of
Faith enables us to overcome every obstacle.</h3><br/>
