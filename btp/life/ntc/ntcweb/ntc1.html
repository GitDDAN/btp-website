The Shunnamite</span> womans faith was built upon reason.</span>God promised her a son. God gave her a son. The son dies prematurely. God must raise her son from the dead because He promised her a son.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>> A man was even raised from the dead when his body was thrown into the grave of Elisha.</span>2 Kings 14:20-21, And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year. And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a band of men; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha</span>: and when the man was let down, and touched the bones of Elisha</span>, he revived, and stood up on his feet.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>b)</strong> The Ministry of the Holy Spirit has not changed.<span> It is the body of Christ that is different. The Holy Spirit ministers through all believers not just a selected few.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Question:</b>If the dead were raised through anointed ministries in the Old Testament then the raising of a dead person under an anointed ministry is not a unique characteristic of New Testament Christianity?<span> What makes the raising of a dead man in</span><st1:country-region><st1:place>Nigeria</st1:place></st1:country-region> a demonstration of New Testament Christianity?</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Personal Story:<span> The Holy Spirit ministering through the body of Christ</span></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">I was teaching this one time at a Nigerian Bible School in London and a young lady brought to my attention the fact that the miracle concerning the man who was raised from the dead actually happened at the prayer meeting of the believers that was taking place at the time of the crusade.<span> The miracle happened through the anointed ministry of the body of Christ not just through the ministry of a big preacher. This is New Testament Christianity.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>2.</strong> The Ministry of the Holy Spirit in the Old Testament was through a limited number of leaders who were anointed.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>a)</strong> The Holy Spirit equipped Moses and others for ministry.Numbers 11:14-30.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>i)</strong> The anointing was on Moses equipping him for the ministry God that called him to do.<span> When the responsibility for ministry was shared a portion of the anointing that was upon Moses was taken from him and came upon the 70 elders.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>ii)"> The Gifts of the Spirit operated when the Spirit came upon those called to service (ministry).<span> The 70 began to prophecy.</span>Numbers 11:24-30.<span> They moved in the gifts of the Spirit.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>iii)> Two of the 70 were still in the camp amongst the people and they began prophesying to the people.<span> No problem with those who prophesied outside the camp prophesy had no impact. The two who were among the people had a great impact.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>b)</strong> Moses knew the difference between the moving of the Spirit and an attack on his leadership.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>i)</strong> Jealous anger can arise when people minister in the power of the Holy Spirit.<span> The ministry of the Holy Spirit was regarded by some as an attack upon the leadership of Moses.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>ii)"> Good leadership will encourage ministry amongst Gods people.<span> Moses said</span>would God that all the Lords people were prophets, and that the Lord would put His Spirit upon them"</span> (<st1:time hour="11" minute="29">11:29</st1:time>).<span> Moses desired that all Gods people would minister in the Holy Spirit - his desire is fulfilled in the</span><st1:place><st1:placename>New</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Testament</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Church</st1:placetype></st1:place>, the body of Christ.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>3.</strong> The outpouring of the Spirit.<span> The prophet Joel prophesied that the limited way in which the Holy Spirit operated would one day end and the Holy Spirit would be poured out on all believers - Joel 2:28-29.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>a)</strong> In the Old Testament Gifts of healings only operated occasionally through anointed prophets.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Those who desired healing needed to go to the anonted prophet</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span> Example of Naaman</span> - The maid of Naamans</span> wife spoke about the ministry of Elisha</span>. Naaman</span> could receive healing by going to Elisha</span> to be healed, 2 Kings 5:3.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>b)</strong> Promise of the Outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon all believers.<span>Joel prophesied that the day would come when the Holy Spirit would be poured upon all flesh meaning believers.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>> Joel spoke about a time when the Holy Spirit would be poured upon the Handmaids not just big preachers, Joel 2:29. <span>Spirit poured out upon (1) Old men dream dreams (2) Young men see visions (3) Even upon the maid servants.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"> Peter tells the crowd on the Day of Pentecost in Acts 2:16<span> This is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>> The time of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon all Gods people and no longer just upon a small number of anointed leaders</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Summary</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The Holy Spirit ministered in the Old Testament through a small number of people who God raised up to lead the people of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>1)</strong> Raising the dead was seen in the Old Testament.<span> The gifts of the Spirit operated through the ministries of Elijah and Elisha</span>.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>2)</strong> When the anointing came upon the 70 leaders they moved in the gifts of the Spirit.<span> This was not a threat to the leadership of Moses for he desired all of Gods people to be anointed of the Holy Spirit</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>3)</span>The prophet Joel prophesied that God would pour out His Spirit upon all believers.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p>
