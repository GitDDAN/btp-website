There and then the whole face of scripture was changed; I ran through the scriptures as memory served, and collected the same analogy in other words, for example <i>opus Dei</i>, that which God works in us; <i>virtus</i><i> Dei</i>, that by which God makes us strong; <i>sapientia</i><i> Dei</i>, that by which He makes us wise.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">And now, in the same degree as I had formerly hated the word <span class="italic text-gray-600">"righteousness of God"</span>, even so did I begin to love and extol it as the sweetest word of all; thus was this place in St. Paul to me the very gate of paradise.<span> In the strengthened armour of such thoughts I began my second interpretation of the Psalms....</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Main Points:</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>1.<span> Righteousness outside of Christ is valueless</span></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Clothed in our righteousness is to be clothed in filthy rags</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Good deeds are highly praised by the world.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Why does God consider them filthy rags?</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Self is enthroned on good works</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Motives gratifying selfish desires</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Our own righteousness will not stand, Isaiah 64:6; Jeremiah 23:6.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Our own goodness or righteousness will not withstand the attacks of the enemy.
