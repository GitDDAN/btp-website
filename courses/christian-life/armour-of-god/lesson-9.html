<p><b>Lesson Nine</b></p>
<p><b>Title:</b>The Helmet of Salvation</p>
Ephesians
6:17
The hope
of salvation enables us to be strong and not to be weary.
<p><b><i>Details
concerning the Helmet:</i></b></p>
<p>The helmet was composed of 5 pieces:</p>
<ul>
<li>1)  a close fitting leather headpiece, worn like a
     cap, with metal  plates sewn
     on.</li>
<li>2)   a
     short peak covering the neck </li>
<li>3)   a
     frontal band to protect the eyes, and </li>
<li>4) and 5)  two<span> hinged cheek pieces
<br/><p>The hinged cheek pieces also protected the ears without
     covering them.  They were pushed up
     from the face when the soldier was not engaged in warfare.</p></span></li>
<p>The bands and raised edges made it strong to resist the blows of an enemy.</p>
<p>Decorative feathers were worn for show but were removed when in battle.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Battle of the
Mind - Losing hope is deadly</p>
<p>Salvation is the
hope of the believer,1 John 3:2-3.</p>
<p>The enemy attempts
to stop the believer trusting in the promises of God so he or she will give up
the fight.</p>
<p><b>He does this by
attacking the morale of the believer</b></p>
<p>Low morale means
little strength.</p>
<p>The devil seeks to
lower morale and make us give up.1
Thessalonians 5:8</p>
<p>Why go on?You are just making yourself look stupid.</p>
<p>You can believe in
God but just don't be a fanatic.</p>
<p><b>He attacks the
faith of the believer </b></p>
<p>Why should you
believe Jesus will come again when there is no evidence that it will happen, 2
Peter 3:4.He
will say it's foolish.</p>
<p>Believers will
then concentrate on family life and earning money.</p>
<p><b>Introductory Story:</b><span><b>The
Diary of Anne Frank (1929-45)</b> </span></p>
<p>The young Jewish
diarist who hid in the secret annexe in Amsterdam with her
family during the Second World War was captured by the Germans in August 1944. </p>
<p>After being
captured, Anne Frank was sent to Bergen-Belsen
concentration.</p>
<p>Anne Frank
believed both her parents were dead.</p>
<p>The death of her
sister, Margot, at the concentration camp caused Anne Frank to lose all
hope.</p>
<p>She died soon
after her sister.</p>
<p>If Anne Frank had
known that her father was still alive then maybe the hope of seeing her father
would have given her the strength to live.</p>
<p>But she thought
all her family were dead.</p>
<p>The concentration
camp where she died was liberated very soon after her death. </p>
<p>'The hope of
salvation' (1 Thessalonians 5:8)</p>
<p>If we have no hope
we will lose the will to fight.</p>
<p>Putting on the
helmet of salvation means that our thoughts and our actions are governed by the
hope of salvation.</p>
<p>It will keep us
from becoming weary because there is a reward for the righteous.Hebrews 11:6.</p>
<p>The reward of the
righteousis not the hope of personal gain.</p>
<p>It is the joy of knowing
that we have pleased Him with our lives.</p>
<h2>Main Points</h2>
<h3>1. The helmet of salvation - the strength to do good works and the power to stand in the storm.</h3>
<p><b>a)</b><span><b>Losing hope will take away the strength to do good works.</b></span></p>
<p>We can become weary through feeling the heat of the battle - feeling
hopeless.</p>
<p>'Don't grow tired in well doing' (2 Thessalonians 3:13)</p>
<p>'We shall reap, if we feint not' (Galatians 6:9).</p>
<p><b>The need to fulfil good works</b></p>
<p>We have been created in Christ Jesus for good
works. (Ephesians 2:10)</p>
<p>It
is fulfilling the plan and purpose of God for our lives.</p>
<p>We have individual responsibility to fulfil the
work that the Lord has called us to do.</p>
<p>We are a body working together.</p>
<p>If
one member gives up there can be a ripple effect that stops many members from
being able to function. </p>
<p><b>b)</b><span><b>Losing hope will
rot a person on the inside.</b></span></p>
<p><b>Story:Tree in the Storm.</b></p>
<p>When there was a storm in London many trees
were blown down.</p>
<p>The next day when I was driving through the East
 End I saw a very big tree lying on the ground.</p>
<p>The tree looked beautiful on the outside, but it
was obvious why the tree had fallen.</p>
<p>Part of the inside of the trunk was completely
rotten and much of it was hollow.</p>
<p>The tree appeared to be healthy while the weather
was mild, but in the big storm the tree fell.</p>
<p>In the storm it was revealed that the tree had
rotted and its roots were not firm.</p>
<b></b><p>A big tree needs strong roots.</p>
<p>The Psalmist wrote about a tree planted by the
river.  Psalm 1:3</p>
<p>The roots had a hidden supply of water so that it
could flourish in the harshest of climates, </p>
<p>Jeremiah also spoke about the righteous being like a tree planted by water.</p>
<span> Jeremiah 17:<span>8'For he shall be
as a tree planted by the waters, and <i>that</i> spreads out her roots by the
river, and shall not see when heat cometh, but her leaf shall be green; and
shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding
fruit.'</span></span>
<br/>
<b></b><p>We must be rooted and grounded in Christ.</p>
<p>The scripture says we must be 'rooted and grounded in Christ'.   Ephesians 3:17  'That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love,'
</p>
<p>Our roots need to be deep in Christ. A person who has no spiritual roots may appear OK when all is calm but in the trial there is no strength to hold them.
</p>
<p>On the outside everything may seem OK but gradually the spiritual life of a person will rot and he or she will be easily defeated.</p>
<p>This kind of person will fall suddenly but the
destructive process will be spread over a long period of time.</p>
<p><b>2.</b><span><b>The hope of
salvation - the strength to live a victorious Christian life.</b></span><b></b></p>
<p>Overcoming trials and temptations,
worldliness, and the cares and concerns of daily life.</p>
<p><b>a)</b><span><b>The battle of the mind - the strength to overcome trials and
temptations.</b></span></p>
<p>Trials and temptations will strengthen the believer in spiritual warfare but if the
helmet is not put on then trials and temptations will drain the believer of
strength.</p>
<p><b>Trials.</b>   The hope of salvation gives strength to
endure trials with joy.</p>
<p>Jesus endured the cross because of the joy of bringing salvation. Hebrews 12:1-2.</p>
<p>He looked to the reward.</p>
<p>Peter tells believers to think it not strange when they encounter trials.</p>
<p>All believers must face trials - it is the trials that bring out the beauty of the
new life in us.</p>
<p><span><b>Putting on the helmet of salvation by remembering previous trials where the Lord helped us.</b></span></p>
<p><span><b>Personal Experience:</b>  Remembering how the Lord helped us through similar trials in the past.</span></p>
<p><span e="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial" styl="">When we see how the Lord helped us in the past then we can trust him in the present.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Experience of others:</b>  Although difficult trials may be new to us, it is certain that others have experienced similar trials.  
When we see how the Lord brought others through similar trials then we can trust the Lord to bring us through as well.
</span></p>
<p><b>Temptations</b>   The hope of salvation gives strength to
overcome every temptation. </p>
<p><b>Overcoming temptations.</b> Looking to please Him.</p>
<p>1Thessalonians 4:1, 'Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how you ought to walk and to please God, so you would abound more and more.'</p>
<p>Joseph said to Potiphars wife - I will not sin against God.</p>
<p><b>Personal victory over sin</b> - the helmet of salvation will look beyond the pleasure or advantage that can be gained in the present. It sees that sin is against God, and it is by nature destructive.</p>
<p><b>The victory of the Church</b> - the helmet of salvation looks to the reward 'to please Christ' so that we are not ashamed when we see him.</p>
<p><b>b)</b><span><b>The strength to
overcome worldliness, and the cares and concerns of daily life.</b></span></p>
<p><b>Worldliness.   </b>The love of the world will cause the believer
to lose the hope of salvation</p>
<p>The effect of worldliness is that it will drain the believer of power and will
gradually pull him or her away from Christ.  </p>
<p><b>Demas</b></p>
<p>2 Timothy 4:10'For Demas hath
forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto
Thessalonica;' </p>
<p>The love of the world was in Demas long before he
left Paul.</p>
<p>He
did not put on the helmet of salvation and the love of the world pulled him
away from following Christ.</p>
<p><span><span class="GramE"><b>How to be
kept from worldliness.</b></span></span></p>
<p>Look at the futility of seeking
after earthly things: </p>
<p>Look at the world: the
uncertainty of life;nothing lasts; wealth can
be lost; thieves steal;</p>
<p>Look at the final outcome.</p>
<p><span><b>The cares and concerns of daily life.The Lord is in
complete control, we will be victorious.</b></span></p>
<p>He will always make us
triumphant (2 Corinthians 2:14). </p>
<p>The Lord is with
us (Philippians 4:5).</p>
<p>Paul told the
Philippians not to worry about anything (Philippians 4:6-7)</p>
<p>Jesus told His
disciples to not worry (Matthew 6:25-34)</p>
<p><b>3.</b><span><b>The hope of
salvation - keeps us from becoming despondent because of opposition and ridicule. </b></span><i>2 Peter 3:4, 'where is the promise of His
coming.'</i></p>
<p>It makes no difference what people say or do because our hope is not built on arguments.  It is based upon the the word of God and the witness of the Holy Spirit.
</p>
<p><span><b>Persecution.</b></span></p>
<p><span>When facing persecution the disciples rejoiced that they
 were counted worthy to suffer shame for the gospel.  The persecution could not stop them.  <i>Acts 5:41-42.</i> </span></p>
<p>In Church History whenever the church has been persecuted, the helmet of salvation has been prominent.</p>
<p><b>Richard Wurmbrand (1909-2001)</b></p>
<p>'It was strictly forbidden to preach to other prisoners. It was understood that whoever was caught doing this received a severe beating. A number of us decided to pay the price for the privilege of preaching, so we accepted their [the communists' ] terms. It was a deal; we preached and they beat us. We were happy preaching. They were happy beating us, so everyone was happy.'  (Tortured for Christ)</p>
<p><span><b>Slander and Ridicule.</b></span></p>
<p><span>The Jews in Rome told Paul that they had not read letters or heard any argument made against him, but they knew that everywhere the Christians were spoken against.  <i>Acts 28:22. 
'But we desire to hear of you what you think: for as concerning this sect, we know that everywhere it is spoken against.'
</i> </span></p>
<p><span><b>Philosophy and Evolution</b></span></p>
<p>Bible believing Christians who attend University can find themselves ridiculed for their faith.</p>
<p>When I was studying at University, a lecturer in philosophy spoke about belief in God as something that has no reasonable foundation.</p>
<p>Christianity is held to be faith not reason.</p>
<p> In the field of biology, Darwin's evolutionary theory based upon 'natural selection' is widely accepted as scientifically proven, and creationism is seen as an outdated myth.</p>
<p>If we do not have the helmet of salvation our faith can soon be destroyed.</p>
<p>The Bible account of creation can be upheld by reason and evidence, but the helmet of salvation is more than reasoned argument.  It is the Spirit of God bearing witness with our spirit that we are the children of God.
<i>Romans 8:16,  'The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:'
</i></p>
<p><b>4.</b><span><b>The hope of
salvation - holiness. </b></span></p>
<p>John wrote that those who have the hope of salvation will keep themselves pure.
   1
John 3:2-3.</p>
<p><span>
<b>This hope keeps us from sin and produces purity and holiness, </b></span>
<i>'And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.(1 John 3:3)</i>
</p>
<p><span>
<b>Day by day we are learning to be like
Him.</b></span></p>
<p>The hope of salvation will produce meekness and humility in us.</p>
<p>When we know who we are in Christ then we can rest in Him.</p>
<p>We do not need to promote ourselves.</p>
<p>We are the family of God; sons and daughters of the living God.</p>
<p>We have been bought with a price; it cost the death of the Son of God.</p>
<p>We belong to Him.</p>
<p>When we know this then we will keep ourselves pure from sin and the world.</p>
<p><span>
<b>Changed into His likeness.</b></span></p>
<p>The Holy Spirit is changing us daily into the likeness of Christ.</p>
<p>All of our daily experiences are designed to make us more like Christ.</p>
<p>We
are being changed inwardly.The Bible describes this a being changed from glory to glory.</p>
<i>2 Corinthians 3:18,  'But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.'</i>
<p>When
the Lord comes again we will be physically changed into His likeness.</p>
<p><b>Holiness is the mark of a believer.</b></p>
<p>The helmet of salvation is the way of holiness.</p>
<p>It is a sign of true faith.  It is the way the new life in Christ is seen.</p>
<p>There are many who call themselves
Christians but they do not have new life.</p>
<p>The desire to be holy is more than doing good.</p>
<p><span>It is not just good moral living. It is the life of Christ working in the believer.
Paul writes <i>` If you then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.
Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.
 For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.
(Colossians 3:1-4).</i> We seek to please the Lord with the things we desire because the life of Christ is in us.</span></p>
<p>Holiness is the life of Christ working in us.</p>
<p><b>The parable of the wise and foolish virgins  (Matthew 25:1-13).</b><i></i></p>
<p>This parable describes professing Christians.</p>
<p>The wise virgins had oil in their lamps whereas the foolish virgins did not.  The oil of the Holy Spirit in the believer is new life in Christ.</p>
<p>This hope keeps us watchful, looking for the Lord's return.
We are to live our lives seriously because the Lord is coming;
<i>'But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.'
(1 Thessalonians 5:8)</i></p>
<p><b>5.</b><span><b>The helmet of
salvation keeps us steadfast in serving the Lord.</b></span></p>
<p><span><b>Steadfast in the Lord's work - labour is not
in vain in the Lord;</b></span></p>
<p><i>1 Corinthians 15:58, 'Therefore, my beloved brethren, be stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as you know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.'
</i></p>
<p>We are to remain steadfast in doing the Lord's will regardless of how small it may appear.</p>
<p>The world honours those who are successful.  But God looks for faithfulness.</p>
<p><i>'Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.'  (1 Corinthians 4:2)</i></p>
<p>A faithful person knows that obedience is more important than success.</p>
<p>We are to be steadfast and immoveable, and always ready to do the will of the Lord.</p>
<p>Faithfulness obeys the Lord regardless of the consequences.</p>
<p><b>The approval of man.</b></p>
<p>It is possible to build up a big ministry by accumulating funds.  A person who can raise a large amount of funds can achieve great goals in ministry.  Large ministries may be highly honoured, but only those who are faithful in obeying the Lord will receive an eternal reward.
</p>
<p>The helmet of salvation looks beyond success or the lack of success and sees obedience as the goal.  There is no greater goal than to please the Lord.</p>
<p><i>'By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.' (Hebrews 11:5)</i></p>
<br/>
