</span></b><span lang="EN-GB">An adopted child is not born into the family. How does this relate to adoption into God's

<p class="Mso Normal"><span lang="EN-GB">Natural adoption is a legal agreement. Spiritual
adoption is more than an agreement it is a new birth. It provides the means to be born into the
family of God through new life in the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p>

Testimony:</span></b><span lang="EN-GB">Born
into the family of God.</span></p>
<p class="Mso Normal"><span lang="EN-GB">When I came to Christ my life was radically
changed. My life was suddenly turned
around from drunkenness to Christ. People outside the church knew what I was really like. The people in the church meeting did not
know. When I was at the meeting the
thought came into my head, you are not like them, leave this place. But I couldnt leave because I was a part of
the family of God. It was true that I
knew little about the Bible and I had been a crazy drunk, and I was not like
them in that way. But something had
happened to me and I had been brought into the family of God. The same life, the life of Christ that was in
them was now in me, and that life began to be manifest through me.</span></p>
