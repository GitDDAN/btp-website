<p><b>Chapter
Eight: </b></p>
<p><b>THE
SURRENDERED LIFE: GIVING OURSELVES IN WORSHIP</b></p>
<p><b>'I beseech you therefore, brethren, by
the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy,
acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.'(Romans 12:1)</b></p>
<p>The next step in worship is the
worship of a surrendered life.It is the
place of sacrifice and consecration.This is a wonderful place of worship for the individual where he or she
gives everything to God.But the worship
of individual consecration is not likely to produce a mighty move of God.This can be difficult to understand because
usually we expect everyone to be moved by our commitment to Christ.Yet this is generally not the case.When people come to the Lord they can
sometimes be disappointed by the reaction of their close friends.They have expected them to understand that
the reason they have become Christians is because the gospel is true.But instead the friends that they have known
for a long time have looked upon them as strange.When we decide to follow Christ, we must be
willing to be regarded as strange even by those who used to be our close
friends.This is also true in
worship.We may expect our expression of
love for Christ to inspire others to worship.Yet sometimes our worship in sacrificial giving not only has no
influence on others, it can also bring us into conflict with other believers. </p>
<p><span>The worshipper at this level
offers his or her life as a living sacrifice.It is love expressed in joyous sacrifice, cheerfully giving all because
of love for the Saviour.It is the
pouring out of our lives because of our love for the Lord.Many people who love the Lord with all their
hearts have laid their lives on the altar, and gone out in Christian ministry
in their homeland or in other lands.This is a wonderful act of worship when it is motivated by love for
Christ, but it is sad when the person does not go beyond this level of
worship.Christian work has often seen
small results because the person in ministry did not rise above this level of
worship.<b></b></span></p>
<br/>
<h3><b>Mary's worship of giving(John 12:1-8)</b></h3>
<p><span>The anointing of Jesus by Mary at
<st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Bethany</st1:place></st1:city> was a
wonderful act of sacrificial giving.Mary loved Jesus with all of her heart.She had sat at the feet of Jesus and listened to His word.She had in her possession something of great
value, an alabaster box of precious ointment.Christ was everything to her and the ointment gave her an opportunity to
express her love for the Lord.Her
worship of sacrificial giving was done openly in the presence of the
disciples.In one moment she poured the
costly ointment on the Lord and nothing could be saved of the fragrance that
immediately filled the room.The disciples
did not appreciate Mary's act of worship, they were only aware of the money
that had been wasted.This is worship at
the level of giving all out of love for the Lord Jesus Christ.It is beautiful, but it is also very personal
and it can be difficult for others to appreciate the value of this
worship.</span></p>
<br/>
<h3><b>This level of worship can produce
conflict with other believers.</b></h3>
<p><span>The worship of Mary in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Bethany</st1:place></st1:city> was an act of
total surrender.But instead of causing
those who saw her actions to be inspired to worship, it had the opposite
effect.They became critical of her.It can be taken from Matthew's gospel that
Mary's sacrificial worship was directly responsible for producing the hatred in
Judas' heart that caused him to betray the Lord for thirty pieces of
silver.It is recorded immediately after
the anointing in Bethany that: <i>'...one of the twelve, called Judas
Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,And said unto them, What will you give me, and I will deliver him unto
you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.And from that time he sought opportunity to
betray him.'</i>
(Matthew 26:14-16)</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span>Worshippers who joyously pour out
their lives in worship will not be understood by those who have no desire to
worship.Many believers have had to face
severe opposition from other believers when they have turned their backs on
success and prosperity to serve Christ.It was not the world that became angry at Mary's expression of worship;
it was the disciples who became angry at her act of joyous giving.When our brothers and sisters in Christ
misunderstand our actions we must respond with tenderness and love.If we lose our joy by coming into conflict
with others then we will go down from the place of worship. The joyfulness of a
surrendered life will be lost unless we learn to abide in the love of the Lord
Jesus.Many who have surrendered all to
Christ have been led into conflict at this level. <i>'If you keep my
commandments, you shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's
commandments, and abide in his love.These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you,
and that your joy might be full.'</i> (John 15:10-11)</span></p>
<br/>
<h3><b>Conflicts within the church</b></h3>
<p><span>Conflicts between believers can
easily happen at this level of worship.In the past years I have seen conflicts within the church and I have
also been involved in some disputes.We
have had to learn many hard lessons through these conflicts.The main one being that they are not
productive and some people never recover from the bad feeling caused by
them.The Bible says <i>'... keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace'</i><span> (Ephesians 4:3);<b> </b></span>we are one body in Christ.But the surprising thing concerning disputes is that it is usually not
the cold and half-hearted Christians who are involved.Disputes that I have been aware of have often
involved people whose lives were fully dedicated to the Lord.</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span>Some churches are proud that they
have no internal fighting, but sometimes this is due to lack of spiritual life
rather than spiritual maturity.A church
that is active on a social and humanistic level, and
inactive concerning spiritual growth is less likely to have a split than one
that is spiritually alive. So then why does conflict happen in churches where
people are spiritually alive?This level
of worship provides the answer.Conflict
among believers will happen when we stop worshipping and become defenders of
what we believe.Being a defender of the
faith must never conflict with being a worshipper.Worship must be in truth, but true worship is
always in the Holy Spirit.A worshipper
cannot fight with carnal weapons.We
must beware that we don't go down from being a worshipper because of our zeal
for truth.The Bible warns us <i>'But if you bite and devour one another, take heed that you be not consumed one of another.'</i>(Galatians 5:15).</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span>We grieve the Holy Spirit when we
lose our joy and go down from worship to conflict.A person who loves the word of God and has
laid his or her life on the altar for the Lord must always seek to remain in
the place of worship.Love for God's
word should keep us from contention. Paul wrote to the Corinthians: <i>'But if any man seem to be contentious, we have
no such custom, neither the churches of God.'</i>(1
Corinthians 11:16)\\Jesus never
compromised the truth neither did He ever compromise His relationship with the
Father.We cannot worship outside of
truth, but neither can we worship if we are zealously defending our own
opinions and beliefs. It is a sad loss if we spend our lives in contention over
a particular teaching when God has called us to worship.</span></p>
<br/>
<h3><b>Peter failed the Lord when he fought
with earthly weapons.</b></h3>
<p><span>Peter was willing to die for
Christ in the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placetype w:st="on">Garden</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename w:st="on">Gethsemane</st1:placename></st1:place>, but he was
still a fighter and not yet a worshipper.He would have fought to the death to prevent the guard from taking his
Lord, and he proved it by attacking the servant of the High Priest with his
sword and cutting off his ear (Luke <st1:time hour="22" minute="50" w:st="on">22:50</st1:time>).Jesus healed the servant's ear (Luke <st1:time hour="22" minute="51" w:st="on">22:51</st1:time>), and told Peter that the
Father would give Him twelve legions of angels if he needed them.Jesus submitted Himself to the Father's will
and rejoiced in fulfilling the eternal plan and purpose of God, (Matthew
26:53-54).He allowed himself to be taken
without resistance, this apparent weakness in the face of opposition caused Peter
to flee along with all the other disciples, (Mark <st1:time hour="14" minute="50" w:st="on">14:50</st1:time>).The
Lord willingly gave His life as an act of worship to the Father.Peter was willing to die for the Lord as a
soldier dies in battle.He was not able
at that time to worship through humble, joyful submission to the will of the
Father.Instead of being a worshipper
he denied the Lord three times.The way
of the cross goes completely against human nature.</span></p>
<br/>
<h3><b>A surrendered life must be offered
in brokenness.</b></h3>
<p><span>This level of worship is also the
place of brokenness where the Lord desires to teach us to be tender hearted,
forgiving one another.We can only rise
to higher levels in worship when we learn to love those in the body of Christ
who have spoken against us.It is those
who are closest to us who can hurt us the most. <i>'And be kind one to
another, tender hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake
has forgiven you.'</i>
(Ephesians 4:32)</span></p>
<br/>
<p>Some years ago I led a church
where there had been conflict before I became the leader.We had a small congregation, but I was
involved in two splits before the church finally ended.This experience taught me lessons I could not
have learnt any other way.I realised
that each one of us in the body of Christ needs to have a spirit of brokenness
so that we can rise above conflict and be tender hearted towards one
another.The sacrifices of God are 'a
broken and contrite heart' and this is the only way to worship.Probably this book would never have been
written if I had not learnt this lesson of brokenness. I could not go higher in
worship until I was willing to recognise that I had to change my thinking in
certain areas.If I had not been willing
to change then I would not have been able to go beyond this level of worship to
the higher realms of anointed worship.There is a danger at this level of worship that many wonderful people of
God never overcome.They do not move
beyond this level because the zeal to defend what they believe forces them back
from being a worshipper.Pride will also
stop us from moving up to the anointing.</p>
<br/>
<h3><b>Preaching must also be an act of
worship.</b></h3>
<p>The most powerful form of
preaching is to preach Christ with a heart that is filled with joy because of
what Jesus has done for us. I remember a time when my wife used to say to me
'Why do you look so angry when you preach?' I would answer 'because the message
is serious'.I still believe this is
true, but if we do not bring the joy of the Holy Spirit then our message can
have the opposite effect of turning people away from Christ.Of course this kind of preaching did not
bring great results in my ministry.It
is easy to put the blame on the congregation and claim that people are
rejecting the truth, but there will never be a great response if the message is
preached without joy. I have now learnt that preaching cannot be separated from
worship.The pulpit is not just a place
to speak; it is a place where the minister must learn to speak as a worshipper.God has not called us to attack people with
doctrine, but we are called to worship, and through the joy of worship to speak
of the 'unsearchable riches of Christ'.</p>
<br/>
<h3><b>This place of worship can inspire
people of like mind, but it often has little effect on others</b></h3>
<p><span>It is only those who have
surrendered their lives as a living sacrifice who are able to reach this level
of worship.It is the place of
sacrificial giving because the worshipper knows that the Lord is his or her
greatest possession.Sacrificial giving
is not just the privilege of the wealthy.The poor widow was able to worship with sacrificial giving even though
she only had two mites, the smallest coin in Bible days.Her offering was special because she had
nothing left.She had given all she had
and in her poverty she could reach to this height in worship. <i>'...but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her
living'.</i>(Mark 12:44).The poor widow worshipped God in a
wonderful way but it had little effect upon anyone else.If the Lord had not brought it to His
disciples' attention nobody would have ever known what she did.Worship at this level is often very
personal, and even though it is a wonderful place of worship, its significance
can pass without being seen.Knowledge
of what has been done through those who have totally surrendered their lives to
the Lord can inspire believers to do great things for God, but this is
different from being drawn to Christ because we have been 'cut to the heart' by
the moving of the Holy Spirit.This
happens at the higher realm of worship, the anointing. </span></p>
<br/>
<p><span>The worshipper is able to move
higher in worship from thanksgiving and praise to the worship of sacrificial
giving.When we give our hearts and
lives entirely to the Lord, we are only giving back to Him that which He has
given us.We are stewards of our lives,
and we must learn to worship in sacrificial giving, and whatever we give to the
Lord must be given with joy.The joyous
giving of our lives to the Lord as an act of worship is very personal and can
be misunderstood by other believers.Mary's selfless act of worship in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Bethany</st1:place></st1:city>
was entirely motivated by her love for the Lord, yet the disciples did not see
it that way.It was the Lord who
commended her for it.Worshippers must
learn to be unaffected by the reaction of others. This height of worship is
also the place of brokenness.When we
worship at this level we must come with tender hearts that are broken before
the Lord to avoid being drawn into contention with other believers.Pleasing the Lord must be our one and only
desire. Those who have surrendered their lives to the Lord will love His
word.But zeal to stand for the truth of
God's word must never conflict with the call to worship.We can only go up to the higher levels of
anointed worship through brokenness and unity in the Holy Spirit.</span></p>
