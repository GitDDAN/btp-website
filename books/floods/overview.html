<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>Introduction<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The 1921 spiritual awakening amongst the fisherfolk of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Scotland</st1:place></st1:country-region>
had a tremendous influence, and many lives were changed because of a response
to simple Gospel preaching under the anointing of God's Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Little has been left in record about this move of God, so
after great conviction of heart I felt such a record should be left as 'a
remembrance', just as the stones were left for a testimony for future
generations in Joshua's day to mark the opening of the Jordan for the Children
of Israel, as told in Joshua chapter 4 verse 6.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This spiritual awakening has a special place in my heart
because it was then that both my parents were converted, which meant that I had
one of the greatest privileges anyone can ever have, that of being brought up
in a Christian home.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As I have traveled the length of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Scotland</st1:place></st1:country-region>
obtaining as much first hand information as possible, I have met with nothing
but encouragement to put on record the things seen and heard.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It has been my purpose to keep this account within a six
month period, September 1921 to February 1922, although it was felt that I
should include the Portsoy revival of 1923 which had a direct link with the
move of God in 1921.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In compiling such an account of this vital period in the
history of evenagelism it has not been possible for me to mention everyone who
was involved.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As a young Christian I used to listen spellbound to my
parents recounting events which took place during the 1921 revival.This created a deep impression on my mind for
to hear my late father tell in the only way he could of how he was saved in the
engine room of a herring-drifter eight miles from the Haisboro' lightship was
something I shall never forget.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When God moved, He was His own publicity agent, so when it
was 'noised abroad' people came from far and near to hear the wonders of a God
Who proved that He was still on the throne.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We trust as you read this little book, the events described
within have been authenticated by the witnesses involved, your heart will be
gripped, and you will be led led to cry out, 'Do it again Lord.'</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Once more Lord,<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Once more Lord<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>Chapter 1<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>FISHERFOLK<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Fisherfolk have always been a
unique breed of people. Living constantly in the shadow of a tragedy, a wife or
a mother as she bids farewell to her loved ones leaving for a fishing trip has
the secret fear that she may never see them again. The fatality rate is very
high in comparison with other industries.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Around the beginning of the
century, the fisher­men usually lived in parts of their towns near the
seafront. Houses were made of granite and often had wooden floors. In the
living room would be the range-fire with a stool extending across the whole
front of the range. Built into one wall would be the "Box-bed", which
was a bed with three sides covered in, hence the name. This arrangement made the
resting place warm and com­fortable. At the rear of the dwelling was the part
which contained the wash-tub and wringer. Nets were often mended in the garret
upstairs or in some cases in an outhouse. In fine days during the summer,
mending would be done outside.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Some of the fishermen used lines to
catch fish. These lines were baited with mussels which were gathered from the
seashore at a place known as the scaup. This was mainly the task of the fe­males,
while the male members went to sea.Whenever they reached a suitable age, the females would learn to mend
nets, go to the scaup for mussels, to sheel and bait the lines.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The staple diet of fishermen was
plain foods, consisting of porridge and soups, with vegetable broth a
speciality. Saturday dinner was salt herring and tattie time. The herring would
be cured in a small barrel at the summer season with another barrel cured at
the East Anglian fishing. Also on their menu would be dried fish, either ling
or tusk. These fish would be cleaned, split down the front, salted and dried on
the rocks.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In some cases church attendance was
regular, each family going to their respective church. Every household had its
own seat in the place of worship and parents would really feel proud going to
church as a whole family. For church the men would wear dark navy suits, while
the women wore dresses down to the calves of their legs. After the service,
especially during the summer, the family would go for a short walk, but
whenever they arrived home their Sunday clothes were exch­anged for more casual
dress. The Sunday clothes were also the attire worn at funerals, which were
occasions of great mourning.When a
disaster took place at sea, it would be a time of deep sorrow, whole
communities lamented the loss of an individual or an entire crew.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Weddings amongst fisherfolk were
times of rejoicing. In the earlier part of this century, a young fisherman
usually chose for his bride a lass from a 'fisher' family, knowing that she
would have a first-hand idea of the hardships he faced. Another reason being
that she would have learned to mend nets, a great asset to any fisherman who
owned gear.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Sea-going men wore thick underwear,
often knitted at home. Their trousers would be made of a strong material, which
gave them the name of "Hairback Troosers". The home knitted
"Faroe</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Jersies" were famous and kept
them warm in low temperatures. Oilskins which stretched down to the knees had
high necks. On every head was perched the well known "Sou-wester",
which had</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">a small peak at the front and a
longer one at the back. Sea boots to the thighs were essential.Women when gutting the herring wore an oil­skin
frock known as a "Quite", this reached almost to the ankles. Rubber
boots were supplied by the employer who was a curer. The head was covered by a
scarf. Each of the fingers would have "Cloots" tied around it for
protection from the sharp knives used to gut. These women work­ed at an
astonishing speed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A herring drifter crew consisted of
9 or 10 men including skipper-mate, five deckhands, cook and two engineers
known as the "black squad".Life on deck was very hard. Seventy or eighty nets had to be pulled in
all kinds of weather. It would be very difficult to get the nets a board if the
wind changed direction after the nets were laid. When the nets were on board,
if the catch was reasonable, the nets had to be "red up" that is
cleaned. This was a task that was performed with extreme caution, as it was
undertaken when the drifter was steaming at top speed towards port in order to obtain
the highest price for the fish. Since the deck crew were paid on a share basis,
every minute counted in getting the catch ready for sale. In charge of the
engine room was the "driver" who kept the steam engine going full
speed. The fireman was kept very busy stoking the boiler with coal. During
hauling operations, if the catch was good, the engineer could "scum"
the herring that dropped out of the nets. In do­ing so he earned what was known
as "stoker", which was shared between himself, the fireman and the
cook. The fireman also took his turn out of the engine room during the time the
boat was fish­ing. His task was to coil the leader rope on to which the nets
were tied. This was a very mon­otonous job, lasting hours on end and it took
place in a small locker room in the fore part of the vessel.Cooking for nine or ten men was no easy task.
As the nets were hauled in the cook's job was to pull in the
"sol-rope" which was the lower part of the net. After the nets were
aboard the crew had to be fed. Every second morning he would clean three dozen
fresh herring and fry them for breakfast. Cooking was done in the galley on a
coal-fired stove and space was limited. Three of the crew members were paid a
weekly wage. The engineer received around £1 10s (£1.50), the fire­man around
£1 5s (£1.25) and the same for the cook. On top of this was the sum received
for the herring mentioned before which provided these three men with
"stoker".</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The </span>1914-18 war <span>had
just finished </span>and <span>men </span>were
coming home to their ordinary way of life. Fishermen were returning from the
Royal Naval Reserve Patrol to take up their work which had been interrupted by
the call to arms.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Steam drifters were replacing the
sailing boats, some of which had been fitted with engines. Mechanical
propulsion brought increased mobility and men travelled long distances
following the herring around <st1:country-region><st1:place>Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
As the fish moved round the coasts, the boats were based at the most con­venient
port.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For a few months during the first
part of the year the most frequented port was Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis,
off the west coast of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Scotland</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
This was not a popular season and often produced mixed results. From April to
June or July the herring would be "swimming" in the North, so the
boats were based in the Shetlands at Balta­sound or Lerwick. This was a very
important season attracting boats from all the fishing towns, including English
ports. Many land based fish curing firms came to Shetland, employing women from
all over <st1:country-region><st1:place>Scotland</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and even as far as <st1:country-region><st1:place>Ireland</st1:place></st1:country-region></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">to gut and pack the lovely large
fish. There was also a base at Stronsay in Orkney. The months of June till
September saw the fish move to an area which could be reached by boats from</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Wick, the <st1:place>Moray Firth</st1:place>
ports, Fraserburgh and Peterhead. In the autumn a large contingent went to <st1:country-region><st1:place>East
  Anglia</st1:place></st1:country-region>, to the ports of Great Yarmouth and <st1:place>Lowestoft</st1:place>.
Some haddock line boats worked locally during the winter with a few bigger
boats going to the "great lines" fishing for cod, ling, tusk, skate
and halibut. Often the fishing season was a failure due to bad markets and lack
of herring.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It was among the fisher-folk living
and work­ing in such conditions and circumstances that God moved in power
during the later months of 1921.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>Chapter 2<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>GOD'S INSTRUMENTS<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This was a time of spiritual
declension. Yet in the mending lofts, on the boats and along the quays there
were those who had a hunger for God. Days and nights were spent in prayer
before the Throne of Grace. God had moved upon the hearts of these people who
had little education and whose material means were limited, but who were
"far­ben" with Him. They knew the way into God's presence and took
time to wait upon the Lord. In a few years time it was proved that, 'They that
wait upon the Lord shall mount up with wings as eagles'. (Isaiah 40 v 31) These
men 'whose hearts the Lord had touched', had received a vision and were wining
to wait upon God until the vision became a reality.Tremendous things had already taken place a
few years previous when 'times of refreshing from the presence of the Lord'
were experienced in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Wales</st1:place></st1:country-region>
during the revival in 1904. Coal miners were converted in their thousands and
whole villages were moved for God. Much more was accomplished in one night than
men had tried to do in many years. On that occasion a humble man called Evan
Roberts was used by God.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Men were being prepared for the
coming days. One of these was the Rev. A. Douglas Brown, a Baptist minister
from <st1:city><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:city>. Son of one of C.H.
Spurgeon ' s workers during the time when Spurgeon was minister at the
Metropolitan Tabernacle in <st1:city><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:city>. <st1:place>Douglas</st1:place>
had this to say, "My father's life was a constant and sacred inspiration
to me, not only during my early life, but in the later years until he fell
asleep in Jesus. Whatever blessing has come to other lives through my minist­ry
and evangelistic work, I owe, under God, to the inspiration, advice and example
of one who by his fidelity to the truth and loyalty to Christ, awakened in my
heart the <st1:place>Calvary</st1:place> passion for souls." There is no
doubt that <st1:place>Douglas</st1:place> had been reared in the principles of
revival through the personal life and teaching of his father.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As he ministered to his
congregation week after week, this shy man, although he had an exper­ience of
salvation, remained aloof from his people.One day he received a new touch from God. He left his pulpit, came down
and walked among his congregation. Everyone received a handshake and when he
confessed his lack of concern, tears of repentance and rejoicing followed. What
a day it was when amidst all the ritual, God broke a man at His feet. <st1:place>Douglas</st1:place>'s
ministry was re­volutionised, blessing crowned it from that day.He experienced what Jesus said in John
chapter 12 verse 24, "Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die,
it abideth alone, but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit." The
transform­ation that took place that day was to be the means of <st1:place>Douglas</st1:place>.
Brown going into places and situations he would never have thought possible,
not even in his wildest dreams. He was to become one of the great evangelists
of the 1920s.The godly Rev. J. Stuart
Holden of <st1:city><st1:place>St. Paul</st1:place></st1:city>'s, <st1:address><st1:street>Port­man
  Square</st1:street>, <st1:city>London</st1:city></st1:address> had this to
say of him, "He is a teacher sent from God. His words have a power of
penetration whether they be spoken or in the printed page. His subject is
always Christ, and hence the Divine authentication of his words, and that has
made him amongst the most successful evangelists of our day."</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It was in February 1921 that
Douglas Brown came into that great experience and fully surrend­ered his life
to God. On the last Sunday of Feb­ruary 1921, ninety six people came forward
for Christ in the evening service at his church. Within four days he found
himself in <st1:place>Lowestoft</st1:place> where God saved many souls at
meetings conducted in <st1:place><st1:placename>London</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Road</st1:placename>
<st1:placename>Baptist</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Church</st1:placetype></st1:place>.In the Annual Report of the Faith Mission mag­azine
"Bright Words" of July 1921, the record states, "Spiritual
blessing has arisen in the East of England. 'All East Anglia is on fire for
God' is a statement made by the Rev. A. Douglas Brown who is being principally
used in this remarkable movement which started at Lowestoft, and has since
extended to Ipswich, Yarmouth and other places."</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Douglas Brown was to be one of the
key ins­truments in the hand of God when He moved later that year among the
fisher-folks. How wonderful to realise that God's methods are men.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Away at the other end of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in a fishing town called Wick, in <st1:place>Caithness</st1:place>, God was
preparing another servant who was going to be used. God takes the most unlikely
people to do His work.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He took David to defeat the enemies
of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region> in
the <st1:place><st1:placetype>valley</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>Elah</st1:placename></st1:place>.Elijah the Tishbite was called to stand
on <st1:place>Mount Carmel</st1:place> against the pro­phets of Baal.A humble fisherman called Peter was to be His
instrument on the day of Pentecost. When God chose Jock Troup for His work, He
was following the pattern He had established in Script­ure. "God hath
chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the things which are
mighty." (1 Corinthians chapter 1 verse 7).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Jock Troup, whose name was to become
famous in many places in the days to come, was born in Morayshire in 1896. He
came with his parents to <st1:place>Caithness</st1:place> as a boy. Wick was
then the pre­mier herring port in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Scotland</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
The. economy of the town depended on the harvest of the "Silver
Darlings", as the herring were called. Jock's parents were well known in
Wick, his father for his skill in playing the mandolin, while Mrs. Troup owned
a pie and tea shop in the main street.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When Jock left school he went to
train as a "cooper" with the firm of Fleet in their curing yard on
the Pulteney side of Wick. This type of work was very hard and required long
hours.Whenever the young apprentice was
free he began to pursue pleasure. At work he became a very skilled cooper.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">War clouds were gathering over <st1:country-region><st1:place>Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and soon the 1914-18 conflict would commence. Jock was called up and joined the
Royal Naval Patrol Service. He became a crew member of the steam drifter
Strombo which was based outside <st1:city><st1:place>Dublin</st1:place></st1:city>
at a place called <st1:city><st1:place>Kingston</st1:place></st1:city>. The
crew was made up of godless men who spent much time gambling.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When ashore, Jock attended Gospel
meetings on a Sunday night in Dublin Y.M.C.A. where a Mr. &amp; Mrs. West were
in charge who were keen soul winners for Jesus. One Sunday night after Mr. West
preached Jock said, "I think I'll get converted." Although this was
spoken in a light manner, the prayers 'of some friends in Wick were being
answered.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The old fashioned conviction of sin
was heavy upon Jock. He stopped swearing, smoking and tried to turn over a new
leaf. During the long days on patrol he was restless, his darkened soul could
find no peace, so he made up his mind to go and see Mrs. West when he got
ashore. By this time the conviction of sin was so heavy that he was afraid to
sleep lest he wake up in hell. True to his resolve, when his patrol was
finished, he went to see Mrs. West, .who dealt with him from the Word of God.
This seeking soul could not grasp the truth of free salvation. While he made
his way back to the ship the Devil told him that he was one of the damned.
Instead of going to the cabin, Jock went into the wheelhouse and prayed to God
for salvation. Immediately the transaction took place and he found "A
Saviour, Christ the Lord". God had got His man who was to be "a sharp
instrument having teeth" in the days to come.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Jock took his stand for Christ
right away. After the incident in the wheelhouse he went to the cabin where the
crew were playing cards and boldly testified to salvation. Some of the crew
mocked, but the One Who had saved him, stood by him. That night he went across
to another ship called the "Sparkling Star" which was on the same
patrol. A stalwart for Christ named Andy Duthie was her skipper and he was
asleep. The new convert woke him and told what had happened. This wise
Christian replied, "Son, you've made the greatest and finest decision any­one
can make. You have a friend in me always." </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Wherever he went the transformed
man testified and sweetly sang the "Songs of Zion".</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In 1919 Jock returned to his trade
in Wick. As he made barrels for the herring industry, the locals realised that
a great change had come into his life. He lived in the reality of 2 Corinthians</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">chapter 5, verse 11, "If any
man be in Christ, be is a new creature: old things are passed away: behold, all
things are become new". Jock
attached himself to the Salvation Army and bore a bright testimony for God in
Wick.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">While in <st1:city><st1:place>Aberdeen</st1:place></st1:city>
prior to going to <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city> in 1921,
he attended meetings in the Fishermen's mission at <st1:street><st1:address>200
  Market Street</st1:address></st1:street>. There he was chall­enged by
preaching on "A clean heart" and a 'Filled Life". As he longed
to be his best for God, he prayed for the experience that would make him an
effective witness for Christ. God answered his cry and something glorious
happened there and then. Jock received such a filling of the Holy Spirit that
he had to leave the meeting.Going up a
"close" beside the hall, he stood alone with God and rejoiced over
what was done in his life. He seldom talked about this experience because it
was so sacred to him, but when he did, he spoke with great reverence. The
yielded life was now on God's altar and little did he know then that God would
take the willing sac­rifice and use the broken but filled life for His glory.
His dedicated heart could now sing,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">"Thy Holy Spirit, Lord alone,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Can deeper love inspire,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">His power alone within my soul,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Has lit the sacred fire".</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">From Thurso on the <st1:place>North
 Caithness</st1:place> coast right south to Eyemouth in Berwickshire things had
developed into a pattern. Gospel missions were conducted with a few getting
saved, but nothing spectacular was taking place. Yet, at Cairnbulg, a fishing
village not very far from Fraserburgh there was a "sound of a going in the
mulberrytrees".Cairnbulg was the home of some well known
godly men who lived in the "secret place of the Most High".Just after the 1914-18 war one such man was
Jimmy "Denley" Ritchie.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A Welshman called Pastor Fred
Clarke came to conduct a series of evangelistic meetings in the winter months
of 1919. These services were held in the Cairnbulg Gospel Hall, known locally
as the "Bulgar Hall", for a fortnight. God blessed His word and about
a dozen souls professed sal­vation. Converted at that time was a young fisher
lassie whom God was to use during the "times of refreshing" in 1921.
Later she would join the Faith Mission and sit under the ministry of John
George Govan, its founder. She was an old woman when I met her and she told me
of how the young converts, when encouraged to pray by Pastor Clarke, prayed for
days and nights. This contin­ued for months, even when Pastor Clarke had left.
These requests were not to go unheard, for God was going to answer the cries of
His people, who sought Him continually.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Pastor Clarke, along with Mr.
George Bell, who was a Scotsman, returned in the autumn of 1921 to the same
"Bulgar Hall". 'On this visit to Cairnbulg, these servants of Christ
laboured with no visible results. The evangelists decided it was time to move
on to fresh pastures. On the Sunday night in October 1921 when the meet­ings
were supposed to finish, Jimmy "Denley" Ritchie came to Pastor Clarke
and said, "Pastor, God has told me that blessing is going to break out
here. You cannot leave." The villages around Fraserburgh were to feel the
impact of God's Spirit from that night on. Mr. Clarke and Mr. Bell stayed among
these villages for four months. Conversions were most evident amongst the 16 to
18 years age group. Young folk who attended the dance hall which was next to
the Gospel hall came to disturb the meeting. One night Pastor Clarke stated.
"The Devil's agents are in our midst tonight, but we are claiming them for
Jesus." So many young' folk were saved the dance hatl had to close. Many
men and women had left Cairnbulg for the East Anglian fishing season when God
started to move.Telegrams were sent to <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city>
telling friends that some of their relations had got saved.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Peterhead also had its characters
who were firebrands for Christ. One of these was "Petrie Shonie"
Strachan. Saved during the year of the Welsh Revival in 1904, Petrie became a
great wit­ness and soul winner. Constantly called at any hour of the day or
night to lead the sick and dying to Christ, this godly soul was a man who never
believed in idle talk. During the 1914-18 war when in the Navy at <st1:city><st1:place>Portsmouth</st1:place></st1:city>,
he attended a service in which the Padre failed to turn up.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Petrie got up and sang the hymn,
"Take the Name of Jesus with you, child of sorrow and of woe". Then
he preached and at the end of the servicefifteen
men professed salvation. He became a soldier in the Salvation Army. On one occasion
the officer in charge took ill and Petrie took the service and preached on
baptism by immersion even although he was not baptized him­self.Later he went to the Salvation Army officer
and explained how he became convicted about baptism.Soon after this he was baptized in obedience
to the command of Christ. In the Army meetings on Sunday afternoons his
testimony would be a real inspiration. Some of those present recounted how he
would stand in the passage with his hands raised to heaven and sing, "Come
hame, come hame, you're welcome noo, your faults will ne'er be seen".</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">His wife was baptized at the mouth
of the River Ugie near Peterhead in the month of Dec­ember when the snow was
thick on the ground. Petrie was a soldier for Christ right to the end. Many
bore testimony to the influence of Christ in their lives through that humble
servant.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Another warrior was "Black
Bill's Robbie". Converted in the "bush rope" hole of a fishing
boat, he had a marvellous testimony for Christ.This rugged character once jumped off Peterhead breakwater in a raging
storm in an attempt to rescue a man who had been washed into the water. He was
fearless in his attempts to win the lost souls of men and women for
Christ.Before he was converted he could
neither read nor write and Petrie Shonie's wife taught him to do just that. He
got a notebook and began to write all his experiences in it. As he gave his
testimony he would hold up his notebook and</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">say, "This book contains the
story of my life since I got saved." His favourite song when giving his
testimony in the Salvation Army meetings on Sunday afternoon was,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">"Lay by your old compass, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">T'will do you no good,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It will never direct you the right
wasy to God,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Mind your helm brother sailor,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And don't fall asleep,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Watch and pray night and day lest
you sink in the deep".</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Andy Duthie was another stalwart
for the Cross. He bore a bright testimony for Christ. As an old fashioned
Methodist he was a great student of the teachings of John Wesley. His fav­ourite
hymn was "And can it be that I should gain, an interest in the Saviour's
blood". The lines which echoed his experience on conversion were,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>"My
chains fell off,<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>My
heart was free,<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>I
rose, went forth<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>And
followed Thee".</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When he quoted these words a ring
of sincerity flowed from his lips.It
was to this brother that Jock Troup came in order to tell him that he had got
saved. Andy proved true to his word and remained a friend of the
cooper-evangelist until he went home to his reward.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It was thrilling to hear him tell
about the incident aboard the Sparkling Star that night in <st1:city><st1:place>Kingston</st1:place></st1:city>
harbour.Andy remained at Jock's side
and encouraged him during the move of God at <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city>
1921, and constantly stood with him when he visited Peterhead.This precious brother was getting on in years
when I was a young Christian, and to hear him give his testimony on a Sunday
afternoon in the Salvation Army, or in the Fishermen's <st1:city><st1:place>Mission</st1:place></st1:city>
on a Saturday evening brought blessing to my heart.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">These men and others would meet for
"Knee Drill" at <st1:time hour="6" minute="30">6.30 a.m.</st1:time>
every Sunday morning when they would shed tears and cry to God on behalf of
souls. It must have been a wonderful sight to see the seats wet with their
tears as these men and women prayed for God to move.Men like "Aikie Touch" Strachan, a
trophy of grace if ever there was one, constantly sought God for the lost souls
of men. Is it any wonder that God moved?These people honoured the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the autumn of 1921 a missionary
from <st1:country-region><st1:place>South Africa</st1:place></st1:country-region>
was holding meetings in a hall in <st1:street><st1:address>Prince Street</st1:address></st1:street>.
Sensing that amongst some of God's people there was a concern for souls which
he had seldom seen, this missionary went to <st1:city><st1:place>Glasgow</st1:place></st1:city>
where he met the evangelist Alex Marshall. As they talked together he told Mr.
Marshall, "I suggest you get to Peterhead, there is a work ripening, I am
sure God is going to bless in a definite way." The evangelist arrived in
Peterhead and commenced a fortnight's meetings on a Sunday night. The following
Thursday a real break came when three souls professed salvation. One of these
was an aunt of mine who went to live in St. Monance, <st1:place>Fife</st1:place>,
where she bore a lovely testimony for Christ during her whole lifetime.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A young fisherman who later became
a prom­inent businessman was one of the three saved that night. He went into
local council work where he took a stand for Christian principles. The third
was a man who suffered a serious injury during the war. As Mr. Marshall could
only stay in Peterhead for a fortnight, Mr. David Walker of <st1:city><st1:place>Aberdeen</st1:place></st1:city>
arrived to continue the meetings. God had begun to move even before the
fisherfolk went on to <st1:country-region><st1:place>East Anglia</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the extreme north of Scotland
Wick became a haven for many fishermen during the herring ­season. Like so many
other ports, Wick shared in the spiritual dearth that abounded after the 1914-18
war, yet when the herring fleets gathered, and Christians joined in fellowship,
Wick was well able to put to the forefront some godly men.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One of these soldiers of Christ was
Billie Stewart who was saved before the 1914-18 war.He knew the protection of God while on a
naval patrol off Shetland during the war years. His ship the 'Adequate' was
sunk but the entire crew was rescued. As a Salvationist he proudly stood for
the "Blood and Fire", and was a great asset during the revival.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <st1:place><st1:placename>Baptist</st1:placename>
<st1:placetype>Church</st1:placetype></st1:place> was blest by the godly,
gracious life of their minister, Mr. Millard.As a caring pastor of the flock, he possessed a trem­endous evangelistic
thrust and constantly held campaigns using visiting evangelists. It was amongst
these men that God had His diamond which was to cut deep into the Devil' s
ranks in the days ahead. That diamond was none other than Jock Troup.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>Chapter 3<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The 1921 summer herring fishing was
not very successful so eyes and minds were turned towards the season in <st1:country-region><st1:place>East
  Anglia</st1:place></st1:country-region> which centred around the ports of <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city>
and <st1:place>Lowestoft</st1:place>. All the boats were freshly painted, nets
repaired and hopes rose for a bountiful harvest of the sea.Soon places like Smith's Knoll Bank,
Haisboro' Lightship, Lemon Buoy and the Scrobie would be seen. These names were
everyday language to the seasoned fishermen. Young men were journeying south
for the first time and looked forward to the bright lights, for some, their
first taste of worldly pleasure. Little did they know that a material disaster
lay ahead, yet it was to be a time that would go down in the annals of eternity
as a great harvest of precious souls.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the Shetland Isles, Isle of
Lewis, Caithness, along the Moray Coast, Banffshire fishing villages,
Fraserburgh, Peterhead, Aberdeen, the East Neuk towns of Anstruther, St.
Monance, Musselburgh, Port Seaton, Eyemouth and even from Southern Ireland,
women would be packing their chests to move to East Anglia. Soon to these women
places like the Deans, <st1:street><st1:address>Exemouth Road</st1:address></st1:street>,
<st1:street><st1:address>Regent Road</st1:address></st1:street>, the Market
Stalls, the corner in <st1:street><st1:address>King Street</st1:address></st1:street>
known as "Peterhead Corner" and "Fraserburgh Corner" would
be familiar in <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city>. In <st1:place>Lowestoft</st1:place>
there would also be many well known places where they would work and tell
stories of their families back home. Truly the East Anglian fishing was a <st1:city><st1:place>Mecca</st1:place></st1:city>,
both ports producing successful boats and fishcurers. Special trains were run
from <st1:country-region><st1:place>Scotland</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to take those concerned south for the season. What many did not realise was
that their eternal destiny would be changed through God's intervention. Sailing
from most of the towns that the women had left, the skippers would set their
courses south. Although very interested in material prospects, the Christians
also looked forward to times of fellowship in the Gospel. Many of these men
would not ha' met since last year.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It was a season of gales and
herring were scarce. Many boats failed to meet their expenses. Some braved the
storms and had their nets torn.Others
lay at their nets for days, waiting until the weather improved.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At this time the Rev. A. Douglas
Brown was conducting meetings around <st1:country-region><st1:place>East Anglia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and was seeing God's blessing in a great measure. The fisherfolk from <st1:country-region><st1:place>Scotland</st1:place></st1:country-region>
were coming to a situation which smouldered with the prospects of a spiritual
awakening.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">How wonderful is God's clock, it is
neither fast nor slow. Just as the Spirit of God fell upon the company gathered
on the day of Pentecost, so God chose to move in salvation blessing when men
and women came from many parts of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Scotland</st1:place></st1:country-region>.God's timing was so accurate. Some of the
first hand stories I have heard are really tremendous. The main instrument in
the hands of God was the Wick cooper, Jock Troup. He may have been limited in
his academic education, but he learned , be willing and obedient in God' s
school.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Old friends met together at
weekends. The majority sought worldly entertainment. God's children met
together in fellowship and drank at the wellsprings of grace.In <st1:street><st1:address>Fish Street</st1:address></st1:street>,
to the rear of the Market Place, the Brethren met in their hall. The Baptists
worshipped in their church behind <st1:street><st1:address>Regent Road</st1:address></st1:street>.
Methodists congregated in the <st1:place><st1:placename>Deneside</st1:placename>
<st1:placetype>Church</st1:placetype></st1:place> and the Salvationists
gathered in their own place beside the Town Hall.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">With a burning passion for souls
and a life filled with the Holy Spirit, Jock Troup accompanied by a few
friends, started to have open-air meetings at the Plain Stone (Market Place),
when the stalls had closed around <st1:time hour="21" minute="0">9 p.m.</st1:time>
on a Saturday night. It was on the third Saturday of October 1921 that God
chose to move in power. Many were thrown to. the ground under conviction of sin
through the preaching of the Gospel of Christ As Jock preached from the first
verse of Isaiah chapter 63, "Who is this that cometh from <st1:country-region><st1:place>Edom</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in His apparel, travelling
in the greatness of His strength? I that speak in righteousness mighty to
save." A young fisherman from Cairnbulg went into the open air ring and
started to sing, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">''It's altered now, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It's altered now, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The devil once had me, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But Jesus ransomed me, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It's altered now." </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When the Holy Spirit took control,
scores of hardened fishermen and fisherlassies were gripped with the fear of
God. They knelt at the Yarmouth Cross and their burdens were lifted because of <st1:place>Calvary</st1:place>.
On account of that event, many lives and communities would never be the same
again. As I listened to men and women who were there on that night I realised
how great was the power of God that was manifested there. One man talked to
told me he was literally "Slain of the Lord" and fell to the ground.
He said, "The ground around me was like a battlefield with souls crying to
God for mercy." My own faith was there, but he was not saved until the
next week when he was aboard a herring drifter, sea, eight miles from the
Haisboro' Lightship.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We may question such happenings,
but similar events occurred when Jonathan Edwards preached in <st1:state><st1:place>Massachusetts</st1:place></st1:state>.
On that occasion men and women hung on to the pillars of the church under
conviction of sin. We must realise that when God moves, spectacular things
happen.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Services were also held in the <st1:place><st1:placename>Deneside</st1:placename>
<st1:placename>Methodist</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Church</st1:placetype></st1:place>
and in <st1:place><st1:placename>St. George's</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Church</st1:placetype></st1:place>.
What meetings they were! lt is reported that they went on for hours. One
particular night stands out.Jock Troup
and Douglas Brown stood in the pulpit of the <st1:place><st1:placename>Deneside</st1:placename>
<st1:placename>Methodist</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Church</st1:placetype></st1:place>
with their arm around one another, weeping as they basked in the Divine
Presence of God. The refined Baptist minister and the rough herring cooper were
united and they became life-long friends. The Market Place and the Post Office
were still the prime places for open air witness. One man who came from Port
Gordon, named Alex Thain, told me that he was strolling past the Market Place
on a Saturday night with five of his friends when some unseen power made them
pay attention to the singing. Suddenly he was left standing alone, his friends
had responded to the call to follow Christ. It was a few years later until Alex
was converted.At that open-air meeting,
unknown to him, was the woman who was to become his wife, Agnes Cowe. As the
crowd sang that lovely hymn from the Sankey Hymn book, number 466, she answered
the call, took the step and has lived for Christ all her life.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>"Oh
tender and sweet was the Master's voice, <o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>As
He lovingly called to thee, <o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Come
over the line, it is only a step, <o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>I
am waiting my child for thee." <o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On the Monday morning work carried
on as usual. Jock returned to his coopering, his friends to their fishing, but
by no means was the blessing of God confined to meetings. On the Denes where
most of the curing yards were and across the river at Gorleston in the yards
there, the songs of <st1:city><st1:place>Zion</st1:place></st1:city> were sung.
Far out at sea as the boats lay at their nets, the singing of men who were
redeemed wafted over the waves. Whenever work was finished, meetings were held.
Often due to bad weather the boats would tie up and many would gather together
at all hours in different places. Meetings would often go on until <st1:time hour="3" minute="0">three o'clock</st1:time> in the morning. Souls were often
saved in the houses where the fisherlassies lodged. In the curing yards amidst
the herring, salt, pickle and barrels there were those who came into the
experience of salvation and had their souls preserved for eternity. It was
common for the foreman of the curing yard to get Jock to lead his workers to
Christ at all hours of the day to they could all go back to their work. The
story is told that one Monday morning, (that was the day the curers would fill
up the barrels which had been packed with herring previously, because the salt
had melted and the fish had sunk in the barrel) that three "Heiland
Quines", (lassies from the Isle of Lewis) failed to turn up for work and
their employer went to see what was wrong. When he found them in their lodgings
under deep conviction of sin, he went straight for Jock Troup who led them to
Christ. They rejoiced in this great salvation and returned to their work among
the herring. Conviction was everywhere, hearts were broken as souls wept over
their sins.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Men were getting saved at sea
aboard the herring boats. As they steamed to the fishing grounds by the Knoll
Lightship and the Haisboro' Lightship, unsaved crewmen would be led to Christ
by new converts. The nets were laid in the sea and as the drifters lay with
their heads into the wind, big rough fishermen, who until now knew no fear,
cried out in terror of being lost in hell.Engineers in the bowels of the ships looking after the coal-fired
boilers were reminded of the fire of hell and the lost eternity which awaits
the ungodly. They cried to God for help and found refuge in Christ. During
hauling operations which took at least four hours and even sometime up to ten
hours when pulling eighty nets, there were tremendous times of blessing. Many
were saved as the nets were being hauled aboard.The soul concerned would just let the net go,
fall on his knees and cry for salvation. What days!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Telegrams brought home news of the
spiritual awakening to the ports of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Scotland</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
Letters told of who and where their salvation took place. A telegram from a
certain Bobby Ritchie read "Saved, 10 miles from Knoll -Lightship, last to
ring in on this ship." All the interest was in souls, no wonder a mighty
harvest was reaped for God.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">During the time when a <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city>
fishing was at its height, it was interesting to walk along the quay, starting
at the Trawl Market, past the Herring Market and continue right down past all
the "posts" until you came to the Freshing Market. The visitor could
not but note the different registrations appearing on the sides and funnels of
the drifters. If this journey was taken on a Sunday, it would be evident that
the boats tied up on the quays were all from <st1:country-region><st1:place>Scotland</st1:place></st1:country-region>
for no Scottish skipper went to sea on that day.Every port represented had its own
registration letters, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">BK for the Eyemouth boats, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">KY for the <st1:place>East Neuk</st1:place>
of <st1:place>Fife</st1:place> villages of St. Monance, Pittenween and
Anstruther. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Drifters from the North East of
Scotland had </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="DA">PD for Peterhead, <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="DA">FR for Fraserburgh, <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">BF for Banffshire towns, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">BCK for Buckie, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">INS for Lossiemouth, Hopeman,
Burghead and Avoch, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">and finally WK for Wick. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At the peak of the season there
would be well over 700 boats based at <st1:country-region><st1:place>East
  Anglia</st1:place></st1:country-region>. When the fishing was over they would
make their way to their respective ports, thus the influence of the 1921 move
of God at <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city> was far
reaching.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On a smaller scale the events at <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city>
could be placed on a parallel with those in the second chapter of the Acts of
the Apostles. God moved on the Day of Pentecost when people were gathered from
many places and they went home with a glorious experience in their lives to be
witnesses to the living Christ. Peter and John spoke the word with boldness.
Signs and wonders followed the preaching of the gospel in Acts chapters 3 and
4.Further on, in Acts chapter 8, we
find Philip the evangelist planting the church <st1:city><st1:place>Samaria</st1:place></st1:city>
and seeing a great spiritual awakening.Then suddenly he is called away south to <st1:city><st1:place>Gaza</st1:place></st1:city>
to meet the Ethiopian eunuch who confesses Christ as Lord. Philip may have had
every reason question the voice of God, but he went.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Jock Troup, while in the midst of a
spirital revival, heard God speak, and had a vision.What he saw was a man praying far north in
Fraserburgh. This man was asking the Lord to send the evangelist He was using
in <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city> north to where there
was a great need. This man had never seen Jock, but he had heard what was
happening among the fishermen. By this time the cooper-evangelist had been
dismissed from his work because of the call on his time.He had never been to Fraserburgh, but he had
no intention of being disobedient to the heavenly vision. Jock told some of his
closest friends of what he had seen and of his decision to leave.They could not understand why he was going
when such mighty blessing was taking place. He knew that the God Who had started
the work in <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city>, would
continue it. Many tried to persuade the revivalist to stay, but nothing and no
one would prevent him from answering the call of the Master. The next day the
evangelist left.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Meanwhile in <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city>,
the move continued.In <st1:place><st1:placename>St.
  George's</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Church</st1:placetype></st1:place>
the mission of Douglas Brown was tremendously successful. God was using him in
even greater measure. More young men were coming to the forefront of the
battle.One of these was David Cordiner,
who was to be used mightily in Peterhead.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As the season drew to a close,
fishermen prepared for the voyage to their home ports. Nets were made up into
individual bundles, spare and damaged nets were taken aboard from the place of
storage. With the anticipation of reunion, courses were set for the North.
Through the Cockle Gate, past, the Haisboro' Lightship, past the Long stones
where Grace Darling became a heroine, the drifters would steam. As the armada
sailed north the numbers would decrease rapidly. Once Peterhead was passed,
those sailing for Wick left the others to alter course to sail up the <st1:place>Moray
 Firth</st1:place>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What amazing stories these men had
to tell.Sins which had haunted them for
years were blotted out like a thick cloud and cast into the <st1:place><st1:placetype>sea</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>God</st1:placename></st1:place>'s' forgetfulness. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Those who worked ashore would be
later in leaving <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city>. The
curing yards had to be cleared up and everything made secure till the next
season. As the trains left <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city>,
it was a different kind of song that was heard and a different kind of language
that was spoken. God was the centre of their conversation.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It was remarkable that in many of
the towns where these men and women were going with their new found joy, the
blessing of God had preceded them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>Chapter 4<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>SOUTH FIRTH<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The "South Firth"
fishermen hailed from the fishing towns situated along the north and south
coasts of the Firth of Tay. They had a herring season of their own in the
winter months, but during the year they followed the herring from the North of
Scotland right down to <st1:country-region><st1:place>East Anglia</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Just south of the Bass Rock, on
which the Scottish Covenanters were imprisoned in terrible conditions during
the 16th century, lies the fishing <st1:place><st1:placetype>port</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Eyemouth</st1:placename></st1:place>. Proudly many of them
sailed their boats south for the 1921 season. A goodly number of them were to
hear and believe the Gospel of Christ. The impact of this was felt when the
converts returned home. These after-effect,s were very much in evidence when
Jock Troup and another evangelist returned to the town years later. As the two
servants of Christ held an open-air meeting, crowds gathered around. There were
some who saw for the first time the man whom God had used to bring many to a
knowledge of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Between Eyemouth and Edinburgh, on
the south side of the Firth of Forth, are the fishing towns of Cockenzie, Port
Seton, Musselburgh and Fisherow. The breath of God's Spirit swept across the
folks from these places in a tremendous way. At <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city>
that year was big John J <st1:city><st1:place>ames</st1:place></st1:city> Horne
of Port Seton. He stood six feet tall, his huge size being evident at the
services in the <st1:street><st1:address>Market Square</st1:address></st1:street>.
He became a personal friend of Jock Troup and was amongst the front liners at
any meeting, whether it was inside a church or in the open air. I had the
opportunity to meet John James while I was conducting some meetings in Port
Seton and enjoyed the fellowship in his home. Abiding results can be seen in
Cockenzie and Port Seton today if you visit any of the churches or meeting
halls, but especially in the <st1:city><st1:place>Mission</st1:place></st1:city>
known as "The Fishermen's <st1:city><st1:place>Bethel</st1:place></st1:city>.
" It was from around this district that a young man got saved during the
early 1920' s. He was to be one of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Scotland</st1:place></st1:country-region>'
s unique evangelists, leading many to Christ, a number of whom became
missionaries on foreign fields. That man was none other than Charlie Main.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As with other places associated
with the sea, Musselburgh and Fisherow have long known the satisfaction and
hardship of earning a living from the deep. These towns were to know spiritual
success during 1921. Quite a few men were saved and on returning home they set
revival fires burning that are still alight today. From this area came Robert
Fairnie. This man of God has done a great work for the Lord in the North East
of Scotland and latterly in <st1:city><st1:place>Bristol</st1:place></st1:city>.
No doubt the men who were saved in 1921 had an influence on his life.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On the north side of the Firth of
Forth there are four lovely small towns each with a long asociation with
fishing. A number of men from these places were converted at <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city>.
Among them was my uncle, Alex "Hughie" Hughes. After being spoken to
by God through tragedy in his family, he closed in with God' s offer of mercy
during the revival. His consistent Christian life was a constant rebuke to men
and women.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Although he did not speak publicly,
his life told for Jesus. Hughie was a gentleman for God, faithful to theiast,
he knew his anchor gripped the Solid Rock.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">An evangelical Congregational
Church stands as a testimony for God, showing that men and women knew the
blessing of the Lord in 1921. A Brethren Assembly meets in St. Monance with
members attending whose parents were saved during the revival.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One Tuesday night in November 1921,
a lassie about seven years old came home from the Pittenweem school for her
dinner. Her mother sat in a chair crying. Her tears were not of sorrow, but of
joy. She had just received a letter from her husband John Hughes telling her
that he had been saved the previous weekend at <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">That lassie did not get much to eat
that day,because her mother was so
overwhelmed. Although only young, an impression was left on her heart and mind
which she can recall with joy nearly sixty years later. When the fisherfolk
returned to Pitenweem they brought back revival blessing with them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Recently the <st1:place><st1:placename>Scottish</st1:placename>
<st1:placename>Fisheries</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Museum</st1:placetype></st1:place>
was opened up in Anstruther. The exhibits show a fascinating history of the
fishing industry. "Anster", as it is locally known, had a great page
written into the annals of God's Book of Life. A number of souls from this town
were converted. The move went on after the fishermen had returned from <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At Cellardyke the meetings were so
large during the months of December 1921 and january 1922, that the only
convenient place available was the Town Hall. Crowds attended the services
which were conducted by local fishermen. Many responded to the forthright
preaching of God's word.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>Chapter 5<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>WHINNYFOLD<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">South of Cruden Bay on the
Aberdeenshire coast lies the <st1:place><st1:placetype>village</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Whinnyfold</st1:placename></st1:place>.During the summer and autumn, the men of the
village went to the herring fishing on the Peterhead boats. In the winter they
took to line fishing for cod and haddock.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the early part of the 20th
century, there were a number of godly men and women who were possessed with a
vision for the young people of their small community. These earnest souls
prayed with "groanings which cannot be uttered" for God to move
amongst them and do a lasting work of salvation. There were few opportunities
afforded for simple gospel preaching, yet so anxious were these folks for
fellowship that they would walk every Sunday to <st1:place><st1:placename>Cruden</st1:placename>
<st1:placetype>Bay</st1:placetype></st1:place> in order to attend church. When
the snow was very deep, the men put on their "thigh sea boots" so
they could make the journey to hear the Word of God. Every Sunday evening a
different minister of the district would come and conduct a service in the
village hall. Even so, they felt that as yet there was no direct answer to
their prayers. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When September 1921 came, a number
left village to pursue the <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city>
fishing, the men to sail in the drifters and the women to gut and pack the
herring. At <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city> they attended
the meetings conducted by Douglas Brown and Jock Troup and a few were
converted. On returning home fresh interest was stirred so these "old
praying saints" began to see that God was answering the cries which had
ascended to His throne.The vision given
to these men years earlier had tarried, now the promise of God that it would
become a reality was beginning to be fulfilled.The young converts, full of zeal for Christ, claimed the village hall
one Sunday a month for a straightforward gospel meeting and God began to move in
power in Whinnyfold.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In January 1922, Davie Walker, an
evangelist from <st1:city><st1:place>Aberdeen</st1:place></st1:city> came to
Whinnyfold at the invitation of a young believer and preached in the village
hall one Sunday night. It was obvious that there was a deep interest in eternal
things, with every indication that spiritual blessing was about to take place.
After that first meeting, it was arranged to hold services in a certain Alex
Hay's house. God began to move in that home, the crowds being so large that
every room in the house was packed, thus it was decided to take over the
village hall. On the next Sunday , the few believers were in a state of
expectancy, God was not going to disappoint them. Some of the young men who
were accustomed to going across to Port Errol for a walk on Sunday had just
returned. These young men had newly begun to taste worldly pleasures, but the
Lord had a different plan for their lives. As they sat on a dyke outside the
hall where the meeting was in progress, they were talking about anything but
the good news of salvation. The Holy Spirit began to speak to their hearts. A
woman who had just left the meeting came along and when she saw her son among
the young men laughing lightheartedly, she approached him and rebuked him
saying, "You should be at the meeting hearing about how to get saved."
To her amazement the whole group got off the dyke and made for the hall. Every
one of them was a big burly fisherman.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When the hall door opened, the
evangelist wondered what would happen if they made a rumpus. He was a small man
and known as "Wee Davie". While the meeting was going on, the Holy
Spirit took control of them. As the gospel message was preached they were all
gripped by conviction of sin and everyone of them was saved before the end of
the service. This was remarkable as they all went on to spend their lives for
Christ. One of them became a grand gospel preacher.A testimony for the Lord Jesus Christ was
established soon after that Gospel Campaign and lasted well over fifty years
until those saved moved to Peterhead. It must be recorded that many of the people
mentioned had the privilege of being brought up in Christian homes. They are
now bringing up their families in the same way, so the effects of the blessing
that flowed at Whinnyfold in early 1922 is still in evidence.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>Chapter 6<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>PETERHEAD<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Famous even then for its prison
which held in its security some of the worst criminals in the land, the town
had many of its inhabitants held captive by the Devil at his will. Many a young
fisherman had returned from the war godless and careless regarding his soul's
eternal welfare.Yet to many of these
men who had seen front line action on land and sea, <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city>
1921 would be a year when spiritual battles would be fought in their
souls.Scores of Peterhead fishermen
were saved and rejoiced in the experience of sins forgiven. Their lives were
changed when spiritual debt was cancelled at the place called <st1:place>Calvary</st1:place>.In some cases whole crews of drifters were
converted, either through attending Douglas Brown's services in <st1:place><st1:placename>St.
  George' s</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Church</st1:placetype></st1:place>
or at open-air meetings held by Jock Troup.Miraculous things took place among the Peterhead fisher lassies as they
were gutting the herring at the Denes on the sea-front.One herring curer told me it was a usual
occurrence to see women crying for peace with God among the herring barrels at
the Peterhead owned curing stations. The prayers of men like "Petrie
Shonie" Strachan, John Noble Stephen and many others were being answered
by a covenant-keeping God.I have
personally heard the testimonies of men and women who were redeemed at <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city>
nearly sixty years ago and they are still going on for God.When the Lord moved, He saved men and women
who established Christian homes, their children were led to Christ and they in
turn are bringing up the grandchildren in the same way.Peterhead was particularly favoured as far as
the salvation of souls was concerned.I
am convinced that this was because godly men and women prayed in earnest.Not only were there new converts, but many
who had professed salvation in former days were called to a fresh dedication in
their experience.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city>
that year was a young man engaged as cook on the drifter Energy.David Cordiner had been saved at the age of
thirteen in Peterhead Baptist Church through an evangelist named McGregor, but
had grown cold in heart during the war years when he served as a corporal of
cooks. David attended meetings conducted by Douglas Brown and Jock Troup where
he was wonderfully blessed and empowered by the Holy Spirit. While cooking a
meal for his shipmates, he took his cigarettes and threw them into the galley
stove.He had made up his mind to be on
fire for God. As he slept one night on board his ship which was moored on the
river, God spoke to him clearly and told him that when he got home to Peterhead
he had to go to <st1:street><st1:address>Broad Street</st1:address></st1:street>
and conduct open-air meetings.David
told the Lord, as Jeremiah did in Bible days, that he could not speak, but the
Lord said, "Open your mouth and I will fill it". After this a hymn
came to his mind, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">"Must I go and empty handed,
must I meet my Saviour so?" </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He cried out that night, "I
will go." Little did he realise that the vision he had received from the
Lord would take him into places and situations where mighty things would be
done through him.Here is an example of what
God can do with a life completely given over to Him. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As the drifter Energy steamed home
from <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city>, the young cook
shared his vision with the mate of the vessel.In reply he was told, "David, you will never do that, you are far
too quiet." It was <st1:time hour="0" minute="0">midnight</st1:time> on a
Friday when the boat arrived at Peterhead harbour. David could never have
imagined that God had decided that he was to be a fisher of men instead of a
fisherman.When he arrived home he told
his godly mother of the vision. She expressed her feelings that he would never
make a speaker. However, she said that she would pray for him, and he testified
that her prayers held him up when he went forth to preach at the Broadgate in
Peterhead, where he saw many souls won for Christ.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">"<st1:city><st1:place>Davie</st1:place></st1:city>"
Cordiner went forth in the name of the Lord, just as his name sake in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Valley</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Elah</st1:placename></st1:place> long ago. The next day
being a Saturday, he did his work cleaning out the cabin of the drifter
Energy.He met some of the young men who
had professed salvation and told them what he was going to do. They were asked
to join him at <st1:time hour="19" minute="0">7 p.m.</st1:time> that evening at
the Monument in the middle of <st1:street><st1:address>Broad Street</st1:address></st1:street>.About the appointed time on the way down the
street, <st1:city><st1:place>Davie</st1:place></st1:city> met two Salvation
Army lads and asked for their support. When they arrived at the Monument they
found a few people had gathered to see the man who had received the vision.
Amongst those standing were "Petrie Shonie" and Alex
"Skelton" Summers. The meeting commenced by singing the hymn, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">'There is power in the blood of the
Lamb". </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><st1:city><st1:place>Davie</st1:place></st1:city>
had taken twelve hymn sheets printed with well-known songs which he shared
around. Little did these men realise that although some of them had only been
converted a few days, they were on the brink of a tremendous move of the Spirit
that was going to have far reaching effects on the town of <st1:city><st1:place>Peterhead</st1:place></st1:city>.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Crowds began to gather around the
small group. Very soon there was a congregation estimated at about 200, all
standing spellbound listening to the cook and his friends telling of Christ's
power to save.The open-air was stir in
progress at <st1:time hour="21" minute="0">9 p.m.</st1:time> After that someone
said that a part of the crowd had gone to the Salvation Army Hall in <st1:street><st1:address>Chapel
  Street</st1:address></st1:street>. When <st1:city><st1:place>Davie</st1:place></st1:city>
and his friends got there the place was full. It is reported that so many came
forward in answer to the appeal that the penitent form was overcrowded and
extra room had to be made for the seekers.Peterhead Salvation Army did not delay in supporting the work of God and
were prepared to make themselves available at any time to deal with troubled
souls. Their hall was opened during the day for special times of prayer and
praise, with gospel services being held every evening.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Open-air meetings were held nightly
at the Monument in <st1:street><st1:address>Broad Street</st1:address></st1:street>,
followed by a march to wherever a special service was being held. Salvation was
now the order of the day, with souls getting saved in their homes as well as in
places of worship. Large crowds would listen to preaching in the open air. On
one occasion the <st1:street><st1:address>Broad Street</st1:address></st1:street>
stance was not available, so David Cordiner decided to hold his meeting at the
Drummer's Corner. It started at <st1:time hour="19" minute="0">7 p.m.</st1:time>
and by <st1:street><st1:address>7.30 Albion Street</st1:address></st1:street>
and <st1:street><st1:address>Marischal Street</st1:address></st1:street> were
completely blocked by an eager audience. So dense was the crowd that the Police
were called to assist.<st1:city><st1:place>Davie</st1:place></st1:city>
was told that he must confine his open-air meetings to <st1:street><st1:address>Broad
  Street</st1:address></st1:street>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One rainy night when the appeal was
made, no one came forward to kneel in the centre of the open-air ring. <st1:city><st1:place>Davie</st1:place></st1:city>
took off his coat and laid it on the ground. A woman came forward and found
Christ while kneeling on his coat. Others, including "Petrie Shonie",
Bill's Robbie and Skelton's Alex followed his example and put their coats on
the street. At least ninety people were converted that night beside the
Monument.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">By now the denominations of the
town had begun to see that the work being done was not superficial, but was a
genuine move of the Holy Spirit. Consequently, doors and hearts were opened to
the young evangelist.The elders of the
<st1:place><st1:placename>Methodist</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Church</st1:placetype></st1:place>
offered him the use of their building. Meetings held there became a harvest of
souls. The years of ploughing and sowing had paid off.A schoolmaster and a student teacher attended
one of <st1:city><st1:place>Davie</st1:place></st1:city>'s services. After the
meeting the student asked the teacher what he thought of the evangelist's
treatment of the King's English. The older man replied, "It does not
matter in the least if his English is not accurate, the important thing is that
he is getting results." </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On <st1:date day="27" month="11" year="1921">November 27th, 1921</st1:date>, Mr. Alex Marshall returned to the
Gospel Hall in <st1:street><st1:address>Prince Street</st1:address></st1:street>
to conduct a series of nightly meetings. Many were saved during these special
services. These converts have stood for Christ for many years.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On returning from <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city>,
Alex "Soldie" Cowe told the minister of the Congregational Church, a
Mr. Hanmer, of the good work that had been done among the fisherfolk.
"Soldie" then asked him if he would consider making an outward appeal
for souls to come forward after the service on Sunday evening. This was done
and at least six made their way to the front as an indication of their desire
to get right with God.As far as is
known, this was never tried during the awakening in the Congregational
Church.After this, the United Free
Church along with the Congregational Church arranged meetings to be conducted
by a Mr. John Moor. An evangelistic
campaign was also held in the <st1:place><st1:placename>Baptist</st1:placename>
<st1:placetype>Church</st1:placetype></st1:place> by a Rev. Gilmour. These two
special efforts saw blessing in a measure, but little compared to that
experienced with Davie Cordiner, who was the leader, under God.One newspaper report concerning Davie
Cordiner stated, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">"The rugged revivalist says,
'Before I went to <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city> I could
not and would not speak in the Salvation Army meetings.Satan had me in his grip, but God did a work
in me at <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city> one night and I
rededicated me life to Christ and His service." </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The paper continues, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">"He spends his time visiting
and telling others of Christ and His power to save, even at the Labour
Exchange, where many people gather daily. One of his qualities is inspired
praying." </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The blessing of God continued on
through December and into the New Year. Then the Fishermen's <st1:city><st1:place>Mission</st1:place></st1:city>
opened in <st1:street><st1:address>Charlotte Street</st1:address></st1:street>
under the leadership of Captain Andrew Cowe.Many young converts were strengthened and a goodly number professed
salvation. One outstanding feature during the month of December was the march
of witness. These marches were led by someone playing a musical
instrument.Scores of new converts
followed on singing the well known gospel songs.This unique procession would start after an
open-air meeting in the Broadgate, move into <st1:street><st1:address>Chapel
  Street</st1:address></st1:street>, up <st1:street><st1:address>Queen Street</st1:address></st1:street>
and on to Buchanhaven.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It was not all encouragement for
the leaders of the work.Many were
critical, others discouraged new converts and some said that it would not last,
but those to whom God had entrusted the leadership of the work pressed on.There is plenty of evidence today, in 1981,
that the work done in the hearts in December 1921 has stood the test of time
for sixty years.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It will be helpful to take note of
what the religious leaders of Peterhead in 1921 had to say about the awakening.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The minister of the <b>Old Parish Church</b>, the Rev. H. D. Swan
said, "I rejoice with all my heart and soul that there is a real revival
of religion in our midst. I was a sympathetic listener at some of the meetings
and found that the young converts were very sincere." </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">"Without doubt it will do
lasting good," said the Rev. A. A. Diack from the <b>West Associate Church</b>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">"The movement ought to be
welcomed. Let us thank God for it," stated the <b>United Free Church</b> minister, the Rev. Alex Lawrie.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">"I have sat with the converts
in my church and have seen the present day production of the disciples in
them," said the Rev. George Walker from the <st1:place><st1:placename><b>Methodist</b></st1:placename><b> </b><st1:placetype><b>Church</b></st1:placetype></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>CAIRNBULG, INVERALLOCHY
&amp; ST. COMBS<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At Pastor Clarke's meetings in
Cairnbulg God's Holy Spirit moved in a mighty way. When the fisherfolks
returned from <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city> it was like
moving from one revival fire into another. Many telegrams passed from <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city>
to Cairnbulg telling of the conversions which had taken place. The Gospel Hall
was consistently filled and glorious times of rejoicing were experienced.
Saturday night was usually testimony time. As these recently converted people
got up and told how and when they were saved the atmosphere was charged with
the presence of God.One said, "I
was saved in the wheelhouse," another, "I was saved while hauling the
nets," Someone else testified that the transaction took place while he was
in his bunk.The faces of those
testifying were aglow with the experience they had with the living Christ.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Every Sunday morning from <st1:time hour="6" minute="0">6.30</st1:time> to <st1:time hour="9" minute="30">9.30 a.m.</st1:time>
there was a prayer meeting. It was held in a net loft above a washhouse close
by the sea and known as "Mary Clarke's Joe's loftie." Heat came from
a small fire and light from a paraffin lamp, but the fellowship was sweet. Ages
ranged from 16 years to 60 years and the spirit of prayer was tremendous. One
man who was there told me how these folks "Grasped hold of the horns of
the altar binding the powers of evil in the name of Jesus." No wonder
Cairnbulg and Inverallochy were moved.Evidence of this still remains.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the afternoon on Sundays an open
air meeting was held in the middle of the villages.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">"Shodie Love" Buchan with
his wife from St. Combs and Jimmy "Denley" Ritchie were well to the
fore.Those who knew Jimmy Ritchie
thought his lovely white beard made him look like a patriarch.Leaders in the open air work were Alex May,
Will "Black Sheep" Third and Bobby "Soper" Cardno.Two young lassies, Katie May and Betsie
Duthie helped at these meetings in testimony and song.They later went to be workers with the Faith
Mission. When the open air services were in progress almost the whole village
turned out to listen. The programme consisted mainly of glowing testimonies and
joyful singing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Baptismal services were held at the
"Water Froth", a burn that ran past <st1:place><st1:placename>Cairnbulg</st1:placename>
<st1:placetype>Castle</st1:placetype></st1:place> into the open sea. Whatever
the weather these young converts would be immersed according to Acts chapter 8
verse 38 and 39. Reports tell me that God blessed these meetings in a mighty
way.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Hymns like <i>"I'm not ashamed to own my Lord"</i> could be heard along the
sands at St. Combs.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A newspaper report states that out
of a population of 1500, over 600 professions were recorded in a
fortnight.Gambling had disappeared;
tobacco and cigarettes had been destroyed.Many prominent Christian leaders visited Cairnbulg and Inverallochy to
see the work of God first hand.One
evangelist from the <st1:city><st1:place>Glasgow</st1:place></st1:city> area
had to acknowledge that the atmosphere which prevailed was nothing short of
miraculous.During the weekdays
fishermen and their wives would leave their mending lofts where their nets were
being repaired and go to hastily arranged meetings in the open air, to baptisms
or to meet in homes.Salvation was the
order of the day.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On Sundays after the prayer meeting
in the mending loft the people of the villages would go to their respective
churches. Some walked to the Baptist and Congregational Churches in
Fraserburgh. Others went to <st1:place><st1:placename>Rathen</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Church</st1:placetype></st1:place>
and the local Church of Scotland. The Brethren met in a loft in Inverallochy.
During the time of the awakening there was a spirit of fellowship between the
different denominations. All were one in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>Chapter 8<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>FRASERBURGH<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What happened at <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city>
was to prove that the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Jock boarded a train for the North
and before it had reached <st1:place>Crewe</st1:place> all those who were in
his compartment were led to Christ. When he arrived at <st1:city><st1:place>Aberdeen</st1:place></st1:city>,
he then transferred to the Fraserburgh train. At Maud two fisherwomen came into
the carriage and sat beside Jock. They had spent the day selling their freshly
caught haddock around the farmhouses in the country. Baskets were strapped
across their backs to carry the fish. The evangelist was asked where he was
going and what he intended to do.He
replied, "I am going to Fraserburgh to preach," and told them how God
had spoken to him. "Where are you staying?" they asked him. Jock told
them that he had no idea. "Listen son, you come and stay with me,"
said one of the old fisherwomen.So
provision was made for him even before he arrived in Fraserburgh.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When he had settled in and had
eaten, Jock decided to go for a walk. He went down to the square in <st1:street><st1:address>Broad
  Street</st1:address></st1:street> where a crowd had gathered. Standing on the
steps of the drinking fountain, he began to preach. Immediately the crowd moved
around him in spite of the cold. As the rain began to fall, the preacher asked
if anyone knew where a place was available for meetings.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">"What about the <st1:place><st1:placename>Baptist</st1:placename>
<st1:placetype>Church</st1:placetype></st1:place>?" shouted someone. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">"I don't know where it
is," replied Jock. "We will soon take you there," came the
answer from the crowd.Off they went
along the way, joyously singing with the evangelist. When they arrived at the <st1:place><st1:placename>Baptist</st1:placename>
<st1:placetype>Church</st1:placetype></st1:place>, the Pastor with his elders
were just leaving a specially convened meeting, where it had been decided to
send for Jock Troup to come and conduct a gospel campaign in Fraserburgh. The
secretary had a letter drafted ready for posting, but that letter never needed
to go through a letter box. God had answered the letter before it had been sent
off. To the amazement of Jock, as the group of elders left the church, amongst
them stood the man God had shown him in the vision at <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city>.
He had come face to face with the man who had prayed. The heart of the
revivalist rose to God in gratitude for leading him step by step. As he led the
singing of the old fashioned hymns, men and women began to weep their way to
the cross. Blessing flowed like a river. The tide of spiritual dearth had
turned and soon God's flood tide would flow.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><st1:place><st1:placename>Fraserburgh</st1:placename>
<st1:placename>Baptist</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Church</st1:placetype></st1:place>
became too small.An application was
made for the use of other buildings, but this was refused because the
evangelist was not an ordained minister. Meetings were then held in the
Congregational Church in Mid Street, with regular prayer taking place in the <st1:place><st1:placename>Baptist</st1:placename>
<st1:placetype>Church</st1:placetype></st1:place>. Nightly souls were under
deep conviction of sin, and after weeping their way to Christ, came to know the
great experience of being "Born again". These were days of blessing
which were never to be forgotten as long as the converts lived.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city>
some notorious characters had become Christians. When they arrived home they
had the joy of not only being united with their loved ones, but in many cases
were overjoyed to find that their families had been touched by the same power
of God. These wayward sons and daughters were saved through God answering the
prayers of believing parents. As entire households made their way to the
services, no one could doubt that the same God Who had worked in <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city>
was now working in Fraserburgh. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There was a spirit of conviction
everywhere.Souls were even being saved
away from the meetings. It was reported that the message boys were whistling
hymns as they delivered their errands. By now, the entire town was in the grip
of the presence of God. Throughout the last week in November 1921, open-air
services were held in the <st1:street><st1:address>Saltoun Square</st1:address></st1:street>.
Many hundreds attended to hear the testimonies of young men and women, then
Jock Troup preached the Gospel.<st1:street><st1:address>Saltoun
  Square</st1:address></st1:street> was the birthplace of many souls who, under
deep conviction of sin, knelt on coats provided by the preachers and converts.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Baptist and Congregational
Churches were throwing their whole weight behind this move of God and at the
end of the day there was a marked .increase in membership as many of the new
converts attached themselves to these churches.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A group of young fishermen prided
themselves in being known as the "Dirty Dozen". When they were
gloriously saved, a tremendous impact was made on the town. A report of the
scenes following some of these services said that many young people were
parading the streets calling upon the name of the Lord.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It was obvious that God's channel
was Jock Troup. This humble servant of the Lord said nothing new about the
Gospel, but it seems that he uttered the good news of salvation with such a
force and conviction that it reached the hearts of the people. Jock was wholly
yielded to the work. There was no sadness or fear in his message, the services
being characterised by joyful singing. Meetings were held every hour of the
day, with prayer sessions lasting into the night. On Sunday the evangelist was
in great demand, no wonder he became so exhausted that a doctor told him that
he would have to rest, otherwise he would kill himself.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Many prominent men from the
religious and secular world came to Fraserburgh to witness the amazing scenes.
Some criticised the work, saying it was because of the poor fishing, or that it
only appealed to simple fisherfolk. Others declared that it was mostly
emotional and would not stand. There were those who had to admit that some
supernatural power was in evidence. One man in particular, Mr. D. P. Thompson,
a student from <st1:place><st1:placename>Glasgow</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>University</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
declared it to be a work of God.He
threw his lot in with the meetings. No doubt it was the influence of those
early days that made D. P. Thompson the man he was in later years, a prominent
evangelist with the Church of Scotland.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On the 20th December, Jock
addressed a packed Congregational Church, stating that the work had grown so
much that the building was too small. During the week the meetings would be
held in the <st1:place><st1:placename>Parish</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Church</st1:placetype></st1:place>
which seated 1200.The Church Session
had kindly granted the use of their church, even declaring that they would pay
the heating bills.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Jock announced that during the next
fortnight he and Willie Bruce would be leaving Fraserburgh for an unknown
destination, and that God was leading them. "The move would be greater
yet" he declared, and told the people that the Rev. Douglas Brown of <st1:city><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:city>
would be coming to help in the meetings. He spoke to his audience in a
confident manner, "Douglas Brown is a small man, but he has both his hands
on God's Altar." The Baptist minister had been active in <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city>
for he had conducted 350 meetings in 3 months.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As the year drew to a close, Jock
received a request to come to <st1:place>Dundee</st1:place>. Ever sensitive to the
Master's call, he decided that he must go immediately. During a farewell
service in the Congregational Church which was filled to capacity, he heard
tributes to the work which God had done through him. Rev. W. Gilmour of the <st1:place><st1:placename>Baptist</st1:placename>
<st1:placetype>Church</st1:placetype></st1:place> said, "A man came to
Fraserburgh whose name was Jock Troup, and the fisherfolks would never forget
by recollection and prayer." </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Many wept tears of joy because
through his ministry they had found a purpose for living.Crowds thronged the railway station at
Fraserburgh and sang as the revivalist left with his companion. As the train
moved out of the station, the huge crowd sang, "God be with you till we
meet again."What a scene, the like
of which has never been witnessed, before or since.It was the first of many visits to
Fraserburgh Jock was to make, the last being in 1953 to attend the burial
service for the victims of the Fraserburgh lifeboat disaster . One of the men
lost then was a dear friend of his, a Mr. Duthie, the engineer.He had been saved in the awakening in
1921.On such a sad occasion, Jock
sang, as only he could sing, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>"In
the sweet by and by, <o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>We
shall meet on that beautiful shore." <o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Those who were there, including my
parents, testified that it was the finest they had ever heard the revivalist sing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A Fraserburgh fisherman named
Willie Bruce was Jock's chum, even before Willie Bruce was converted. During
the daytime they worked together, but at night they went their separate ways.
Bruce was quiet, reserved young man, but when God saved him, this expert dancer
and roller-skater became a lion for Christ, declaring His Gospel with great
boldness. At the height of the revival in <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city>,
Willie said to Jock in prophetic terms, "Jock, after this year you are not
bound for Wick this time, it's the Broch." </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>Chapter 9<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>GAMRIE<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The rugged coast of <st1:place>Banffshire</st1:place>
has stood many as storm.Exposed to
winds of nearly 180° of the compass, the cliffs on the east of the county stand
vertical to the sea. Villages such as Gardenston and Pennan look as thought
they have been hewn out of the cliff face.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Pennan and Gardenston, the latter
locally known as Gamrie, have been the homes of many well-known fishermen.They were experts in driftnet fishing,
especially in the lochs of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Scotland</st1:place></st1:country-region>.Traditionally the men from these two villages
based their boats at <st1:place>Lowestoft</st1:place> during the East Anglian
season.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As the folks left their comfortable
homes in the two villages, little did they realise that many of them would
return two months later as "new creatures in Christ", putting their
trust in the Blest Rock of Ages.<st1:place>Lowestoft</st1:place>
was to know showers of blessing in a rich harvest of souls amongst the Pennan
and Gamrie people.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><st1:place><st1:placename>London</st1:placename>
<st1:placename>Road</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Baptist</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Church</st1:placetype></st1:place>
was the main venue for the revival meetings.Rev. A. Douglas Brown was the leader, but one of the prominent features
in this move of the Lord was the deep conviction of sin.The story is told of a Gamrie fisherman who
left a meeting deeply moved.As he made
his way past the railway station, across <st1:place><st1:placename>Waverly</st1:placename>
<st1:placetype>Bridge</st1:placetype></st1:place> to his boat, he could hold
out no longer against the Spirit of God.He put his head in his hands, leaned against the bridge, looked into the
waters of the Waverly Dock and committed his life into the hands of Jesus.Instantly he knew forgiveness and the Spirit
of God witnessed with his spirit that he was a child of God.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One night as Douglas Brown preached
on the left water pot, from John chapter 4, the Holy Spirit moved through the
building, many fell prostrate before under mighty conviction.A number of Pennan and Gamrie men were saved
that night.In my possession is that
sermon which was preached.I treasure it
very much.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Another characteristic of the <st1:place>Lowestoft</st1:place>
revival was the number who were also baptized by immersion.This took place at the sea front before large
crowds.These young converts were not
ashamed to own their Lord.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After the herring season ended, the
inhabitants of Gamrie and Pennan eagerly awaited the return of their loved
ones.No one could argue against the
changed lives of hardened drunkards who had been transformed by sovereign
grace.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Wise old men who had known the
power of Christ in their lives for many years gathered the young converts
together for fellowship in a building called "Castle Grant".This three-storied building was owned by a
man called Francis Wiseman, or "Fish Francie" as he was named.It had been used mainly as a net store.Precious times of blessing were experienced
in the middle story.Crowds would sit on
herring "nets drinking in the words of life.Young converts were taught the Word of God,
while hardened sinners found salvation to be the answer to their long search
for peace.""Fish <st1:country-region><st1:place>France</st1:place></st1:country-region>",
in giving his testimony would say, "I used to be like the boaties in the
harbour tied fore and aft, but now I am loosed in Jesus.It all happened when I was converted." </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A leading part in these meetings
was taken by a man called "Soldie" Watt of the steam drifter Gowan
Bank.Another of the stalwarts was
Willie "Shippie" West.His
grandson, Alex Jack, tells in a gospel leaflet the story of "Shippie"
crossing to Shetland one stormy night when the steamer struck a rock.As a fisherman he knew the danger they were
in, so he made his way along the passenger deck towards the lifeboats and there
he saw a lady sitting there quite composed.Going across to her he said, "What a night to be on a rock."
Quickly she replied, "It is grand to be on The Rock on a night like
this." "Shippie" knew exactly what she meant as he had
experienced the truth of Isaiah chapter 32, verse 2."A man shall be as a hiding place from
the wind, and as a covert from the tempest."Earlier in life he realised that in the gathering
storms of time there was only one safe refuge - Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There were also some light moments
in Castle Grant.One night as the
meeting progressed, a bag of potatoes burst and scattered all over the
floor.As the crowd picked them up,
someone started to sing, "What a gathering".</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Today, after almost 60 years, the effects of the revival are
still visible in the Church of Scotland, which is outstanding in its
evangelical testimony, and a thriving Brethren Assembly.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>Chapter 10<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>CULLEN, PORTKNOCKIE
&amp; FINDOCHTY<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Fishing had for decades been the
only source of financial income for the Banffshire towns of Cullen, Portknockie
and Findochty.The inhabitants of these
places were closely knit, they rejoiced together in happy times and sorrowed
together in times of disaster.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Many left at the annual exodus for
the East Anglian fishing, indeed, whole families made the journey south in
order to either catch, gut or pack the silver darlings.Children of school age were taught in schools
at <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city> or <st1:place>Lowestoft</st1:place>,
while those under five would be left in the care of friends or grandparents.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">These three towns were to know a
rich harvest, far beyond that which had been thought possible.Whole families were converted to Christ, even
before they returned north.When they
did arrive in their respective towns, the blessings received at <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city>
did not subside, but flowed on and spread into the neighbouring villages and
district.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Christians of Cullen, some who
had been revived and others just saved, were to play a prominent part in the
move of the Holy Spirit in Portsoy in 1923.When Captain William Leed and Lieutenant A. E. Towne, the Salvation Army
officers at Cullen decided to go to Portsoy for meetings in March 1923, they
were supported by a loyal band of Christians on fire for God, from Cullen.These folks were willing to cycle even in
winter weather in order to tell their neighbouring townsfolks of the One Who is
mighty and strong to save.No wonder
Portsoy, Sandend and other villages were moved by revival blessing and many
were saved.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There were others who unashamedly
blazed the trail for God, because wherever the men of Portknockie went in
pursuit of their calling as fishermen, they would fearlessly and fervently
proclaim by life and lip that Christ is the answer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One of the well-known characters
around the Banffshire fishing villages at that time was a fisherman from
Portknockie called John Innes.Saved at
the turn of the century, John was tall, of erect bearing, and could often be
seen standing alone at some street corner, holding forth the word of life.His preaching took its character from his way
of life and was invariably interspersed with quaint witticisms.Preaching in the days when radio was in its
infancy, he would say, "I'm always tuned in to glory."The words of the song he frequently sang
revealed how this man of God saw the journey of life as a voyage at sea, and
how one needed Jesus as a pilot.Those
who heard him sing said that he sang with conviction and the passion that only
a soul burdened for others could sing.This is his song:-</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>"Ye
sons of the main that sail o'er the flood <o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Whose
sins like a mountain, have reached unto God,<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Remember
the short voyage of life soon will end, <o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>And
so brother sailor, make Jesus your friend<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Look
astern on your life, see your way marked by sin,<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>See
what dangers your vessel and cargo are in, <o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>If
the hard rocks of death should grate on your keel, <o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Can
you say with assurance, your soul will be well?<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Lay
by your old compass, it will do you no good, <o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>It
n 'er can direct you the right way to God,<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Mind
your helm brother sailor and don't fall asleep, <o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Or
you vessel and cargo will sink in the deep. <o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>There
are treacherous shoals then on every hand, <o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>On
the voyage of life, to that happy land, <o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Consult
your chart and compass every day, <o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>And
your vessel will sail safely on all the way.<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>With
the Pilot on board we can sail right along, <o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Through
calms and through storms till we reach our blest home, <o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Then
come unto Jesus, my dear sinner friend, <o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>For
remember the short voyage of life will soon end."<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A few miles west of Portknockie is
the town known locally as "Finichty".Around the first two decades of the 20th
century Findochty contained some tremendous men and women of God.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One such was James Campbell, a
Sergeant-major in the local Salvation Army Corps.James preached in his sea-boots in <st1:street><st1:address>Church
  Street</st1:address></st1:street>, warning souls to "flee from the wrath
to come".He later took a bad
stroke which immobilized him, but he was prayed for, got marvellously healed,
then visited every home in the town and district.His prayer life was tremendous.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Another was James
"Callie" Campbell.Some of his
family did not enjoy a full measure of health, but this only drove those
saintly souls nearer to the Christ they loved.He proved God in these circumstances, because his faith in Christ was as
deep as the sea that he sailed in search of a modest living for his family.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One man who was always rejoicing in
his Saviour was George Flett.Known
locally as "Sailor", he played his cornet in the Salvation Army
meetings.He is reputed to have played
his instrument to the glory of God in every port he visited as a
fisherman.His one-man, plus God, open
air meetings were well listened to.What
a character for Jesus, Finlay flett was.With his boat, "Brae Flett", he moved to Wick, taking his whole
family with him, and proved his worth as a Salvationist.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It was a privilege of mine to know
another stalwart of these days of revival.I met Bill Bruce while I was conducting a Gospel Campaign in a tent at
Buckie in 1964.Immediately a great
friendship was forged between us.The
sweetness of the fellowship in his home with his dear wife "Lass"
will live with me for a long time.As I
sat and drank in the stories of triumphs for the Cross, my heart would just
cry, "Lord, do it again." These few men along with others stood for
the truths of the Gospel even before 1921.No wonder Findochty was especially blest when God moved amongst the
fisher folks.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The weekend after the drifters had
sailed for <st1:country-region><st1:place>East Anglia</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
a Salvation Army Officer along with a mother and her young lassie walked up the
hill after the meeting in the Salvation Army Hall.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Then the captain remarked that
there were only eleven or twelve in the service due to the fishing and lack of
interest in spiritual things.Suddenly
the three stopped in their tracks as they realised the situation.They fell on their knees and began to pray,
crying upon God to do something.Soon
their hearts were at rest as they were assured that something great was on .the
way.As they arose from their knees that
Sunday night, souls belonging to their beloved town were finding Jesus Christ
as their Saviour, hundreds of miles away in <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city>
and <st1:place>Lowestoft</st1:place>.Nearly sixty years later the sacredness of that moment dawned upon me as
I listened to the young lassie, now an old woman tell me the story.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">During that next week letters and
telegrams began to arrive at Findochty, telling of the blessing flowing at <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city>.Some of the most unlikely characters were
being saved there.But things were
happening here at home.Women were
converted at the wash-tub, in the shops and in the mending lofts.By the next weekend there was a large
improvement in the attendance at the meeting house.When the folks returned from the fishing, the
difference was remarkable.Homes were
united in Christ, wayward families saved and set free.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The record states that as the men
walked from Buckie to Findochty, a distance of two or three miles, the songs of
their pilgrimage to heaven were sung all the way.One of the most noteable features of the move
of God in Findochty was that nearly every afternoon of the winter of 1921-22
groups of newly saved souls would leave the town and go into the neighbouring
villages and preach the Gospel of Christ with remarkable results.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The abiding fruit of these few
months are still evident, with another generation experiencing the same Christ
as Saviour today in "Finichty".</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>BURGHEAD &amp; HOPEMAN<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Snugly situated at the top of the <st1:place>Moray
 Firth</st1:place> are the fishing villages of Burghead and Hopeman.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Boats belonging to these ports
proudly display the <st1:place>Inverness</st1:place> registration.This is also the registration of boats from
Avoch and the Black Isle.Many from
these three villages were greatly blest by the revival.Their hearts burned with the fire of God as
they sailed home along the <st1:place>Moray Firth</st1:place>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There were impressive scenes at
Hopeman and Burghead as the men returned from <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city>,
and likewise among the women as they made their journey home by train and
bus.Eyewitnesses at the harbour state
that what they saw and heard was fantastic.As the boats waited for the tide to allow them to enter the port, songs
of a new experience that had taken place in many hearts wafted across the water.The tide of God's blessing was about to flow
into and through these villages.Sceptics were able to see with their own eyes drunkards who had been
saved, and self righteous souls who had relied on their works had taken their
stand as guilty sinners.Now all
rejoiced in the knowledge of salvation by grace alone.Broken homes had been mended and that all
through the work of Christ on the Cross at <st1:place>Calvary</st1:place>.Truly this song could be sung in these
villages:-</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>"The
broken strands of life can all be mended, <o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>By
the dear hand of Christ my Lord."<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A service was held in a hall at
Hopeman on the first Sunday of December, 1921, when a large crowd
attended.There about twenty men and
women came forward in answer to the appeal.On the Monday five or six responded to the altar call.God was working.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">An open-air meeting held one
Tuesday in December drew a large audience.After this a march of witness moved along <st1:street><st1:address>Harbour
  Street</st1:address></st1:street> when well known hymns were sung.As new converts walked alongside stalwarts, a
deep impression was made on many hearts as the question, "Are you washed
in the blood of the Lamb?" rang through the town. "Yes I'm washed in
the blood of the Lamb," echoed through the air, and Hopeman witnessed the
power of the risen Christ in the hearts of men.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In an interview a fisherman convert
revealed this amazing story.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">"I attended a meeting in <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city>
which lasted four hours.The Rev.
Douglas Brown preached that night and the presence of God was
overpowering.I saw men and women openly
weeping over their sins.There were
about two hundred converts that night.It was the best four hours I ever spent, but best of all, I went back
the next night and was saved." </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Burghead was not moved to the same
depth that Hopeman was.Nevertheless,
the revival was hailed with great enthusiasm.A middle aged convert was asked what he thought of the revival.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">"I believe God is
working.The meetings are creating a
great impression.People are locking
their doors and leaving the mending lofts.They are making for the meetings to hear the young fishermen speak.Some people are sceptical, but just look at
the drunkards who have been converted.It is evident that they have met the Master, and the joy expressed on
their faces show it is a work of the Lord." </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">An estimate given at the time of
the revival stated that there were well over one hundred converts who were
genuinely saved.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>Chapter 12<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>WICK</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The well-known Pilgrim Preachers
arrived in Wick at the beginning of October 1921 and started holding meetings
in the <st1:place><st1:placename>Baptist</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Church</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
where the Rev. Millard ministered the Word faithfully every Sunday. Full of
zeal for God, the evangelists held open air meetings at the foot of the cliff
at the south end of the bridge. By their fearless proclamation of the Gospel
and with bright singing souls were drawn to the meetings in the <st1:place><st1:placename>Baptist</st1:placename>
<st1:placetype>Church</st1:placetype></st1:place>, where fifteen or sixteen,
mainly young people, professed salvation. God had begun to move in Wick.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Away in Yarmouth God was moving
among the Wick fishermen. Around six were converted, some of them notorious
characters. Among these men were Don Rosie and John Flett, both of the motor
drifter Brae Flett. One man relates how he walked from Gorleston to <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city>.
As he walked slowly up <st1:street><st1:address>King Street</st1:address></st1:street>
with no intention of going to any gospel meeting, for he had no interest in
eternal things, he heard singing coming from <st1:place><st1:placename>St.
  George' s</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Church</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
where the Rev. Douglas Brown was conducting services. A power outside himself
drew him into the church. When the appeal was made he responded by making his
way to the front. He fell on his knees and was saved although no one spoke to
him personally, because so many had come forward. This man walked back to his
boat, the Mizpah, which was moored at Gorleston and told his skipper who was the
well-known salvationist Billie Stewart. Billie took him down to the forecastle
where the motor drifters had steam boilers to drive their capstans, prayed and
sang the hymn "At the cross, at the cross, where I first saw the
Light". There in the dark part of the fishing boat the assurance of.
salvation entered that man's soul. The next day, which was a Sunday, the man
was taken along to the Salvation Army in <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city>
by Billie Stew art and Skipper Flett of the Brae Flett where there was much
rejoicing over this man's conversion.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As the fishermen of Wick returned
home, the converts were alive for God. On <st1:date day="23" month="11" year="1921">Friday the 23rd November 1921</st1:date>, all these men attended the
meeting held by the Pilgrim Preachers in the <st1:place><st1:placename>Wick</st1:placename>
<st1:placename>Baptist</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Church</st1:placetype></st1:place>.
That night Billie Stew art sang the hymn,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>"Ho!
ev'ry one that is thirsty in spirit, <o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Ho!
ev 'ry one that is weary and sad;<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Come
to the fountain, there's fulness in Jesus, <o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>All
that you're longing for, come and be glad.<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>'I
will pour water on him that is thirsty, <o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>I
will pour floods upon the dry ground;<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Open
your hearts for the gift I am bringing;<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>While
you are seeking Me, I will be found.'<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is reported that the atmosphere
was charged with the power of the Holy Spirit and in the meeting some precious
souls found Christ. After the service Billie gathered all the young converts
together and said, "Boys I'm a Salvationist, I'll be going to the
Salvation Army tomorrow night. If you want to come, "meet me outside the
Army Hall at <st1:time hour="7" minute="0">7 o'clock</st1:time>." Captain
Reid and Lieutenant Long were the officers in charge at Wick and they had a
real burden for souls. At that Saturday night meeting things began to happen as
God started to move. When the service was over the converts went out to an open
air meeting at the market place. Sunday was a great day, for souls were saved
in every meeting. Later that evening they went into the open air. Eyewitnesses
told of how the market place was filled with people, one estimate put the
number at a thousand. Men and women witnessed of their new found joy till after
<st1:time hour="23" minute="0">11 p.m.</st1:time></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">By Monday, 26th November, almost
the entire population of Wick was talking about the revival.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There was a deep sense of' God's
presence. At an open-air service on the Brae-Head above the harbour at the
Pulteney side of Wick these young souls, some only converted for a few hours,
boldly testified of Christ' s redeeming power. Two well known young fishermen
came out of the public house across from the meeting and John Flett, who had
recently been saved in <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city>,
went over to one of them and said, "I believe if you get saved hundreds
will follow and get converted after you. " These two men joined the crowd
and went to the market place. Later on the meeting moved to the Salvation Army
Hall which was crowded, some having to sit on the windows. That night the young
man whom John Flett spoke to was converted and became a Salvationist. Many
others found Christ that night. The <st1:place><st1:placename>Baptist</st1:placename>
<st1:placetype>Church</st1:placetype></st1:place> was also packed to capacity
with people seeking God.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Tuesday the 27th was the greatest
night of all.After the meetings indoors
there was a. tremendous open air service in the market place where it was
estimated that over one hundred and twenty accepted Christ as their personal
Saviour. Witnesses of this great event tell of how hardened men and women broke
down, and with tears of repentance cried upon God for mercy. The young converts
took off their coats and laid them on the ground so that those who desired
could kneel in comfort. From that night the blessing spread like wildfire.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Those who were leading the work
came under exceptional strain. Conducting meetings, holding nights of prayer
and praise, leading enquirers to Christ all took their toll on the health of
those concerned. Captain Reid of the Salvation Army became ill. Young
Lieutenant Long found herself in charge of the work. God used that young woman
mightily in His service. The open air services at the Brae-Head brought out
large crowds and on several occasions at least four streets were blocked.
Listeners were amazed as the young Christians fluently quoted scripture. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A convert who later became a
Salvation Army Officer, eventually rising to the rank of Brigadier, tells of
these meetings. "I was unsaved and unmoved when the awakening started. As
cashier of the Breadalban Picture House, I can say that hardly anyone was
attending the cinema, at one showing there were only five present. I would be
going to my work at <st1:time hour="19" minute="0">7 p.m.</st1:time> when the
crowds were so large I could not get through and had to make a detour around
back streets to get to my place of employment." </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Brigadier Rosie goes on to give her
testimony.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">"I was saved in the New Year
in the Rifle Hall. The crowds were so large that the Rifle Hall had to be taken
over as it was the only Hall big enough, yet even that was too small. Six
months later I came into the experience of scriptural holiness and could sing
from a clean heart's experience,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>'I'm
more than conqueror through His blood, <o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Jesus
saves me now, <o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>I
rest beneath the shield of God, <o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Jesus
saves me now.'"<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Our sister went to the Salvation
Army Training College and became an officer in many Corps where a great work
was done. Her sweet voice could be heard singing the songs of <st1:city><st1:place>Zion</st1:place></st1:city>.
She testified that the work done in her heart in 1922 has lasted well over
fifty years. When the Lord builds the house, it stands. During her forty years
active service she has seen wonderful things. "What evidences of God's
work there was," she said. "One young Christian had a melodeon and he
would lead sometimes well over 500 in a march of witness from the Barrigol Hall
to the Salvation Army." What a sight this must have been.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In these times of refreshing it was
wonderful to witness that all believers were united in Christ.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The one aim was to see souls
rescued from sin.Mr. Millard of the <st1:place><st1:placename>Baptist</st1:placename>
<st1:placetype>Church</st1:placetype></st1:place> was at home on the Salvation
Army platform as were the Salvation Army Officers in his pulpit.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <st1:place><st1:placename>Baptist</st1:placename>
<st1:placetype>Church</st1:placetype></st1:place> in <st1:street><st1:address>Union
  Street</st1:address></st1:street> was another place that experienced great
blessing.Their minister, the godly Rev.
Millard threw himself into the work with all his heart. He was greatly used in
leading men and women to Christ, and was called upon at all hours to help sin
sick souls.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">His church was constantly filled,
most of the time there was standing room only. Prayer meetings played a very
important part in his ministry.The
testimony meetings on Sunday afternoons were special occasions. Don Rosie told
of how he stopped smoking six weeks before he got saved in a meeting run by
Douglas Brown at <st1:place><st1:placename>St. George's</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Church</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
<st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city>. It was said that he was
one of God's gentlemen. He sailed in the motor drifter Brae Flett with the
Flett brothers, and at one time the entire crew were all saved men. Another
hard case, an engineer of a steam drifter said, </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">"You ask me how I know I'm
saved? I'll tell you.Before I got saved
I would find myself under the bed on a Sunday morning because I was so drunk
that I could not get into it on Saturday night. Now, I am in bed on a Sunday
morning for I have never touched a drop of drink since I got saved." </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">These converts were new creatures
in Christ, and they knew it. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">"I'm saved, I know I'm saved
cried one fisherman. How do I know?Well, yesterday I went into Walter' Craig's shoppie and on the counter
were some knives. I could not steal them. Before I got saved I would have had
two or three in my pocket." </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">How these uneducated men loved to
tell in their own way the change that had been wrought in their lives since
Jesus had come to abide in their hearts. They were so keen to testify that the
leader during a meeting had to insist on order as two or three would have
spoken at once.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A Salvation Army Staff Captain,
Mrs. Rohu from <st1:city><st1:place>Aberdeen</st1:place></st1:city>, arrived to
help in the meetings along with the wife of the officer from Thurso. They
proved to be a tremendous asset to those who had borne the strain of the work
in the early days of the awakening. The meetings continued to gather strength
during the month of December and the young converts stood over the New Year
period with their colours flying. At the turn of the year many of the young men
had the joy of seeing their parents become Christians. There was a marked
improvement in the preaching of these young converts and it became obvious that
they had become students of the Bible. They quoted with accuracy and clarity'
as they testified for Christ. During the first week of January 1922 these young
men started to travel to the villages around Wick to take services. Among the
places visited were Ackergill and Staxigo. Precious souls were converted
through their witness.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Jock Troup arrived home at Wick on <st1:date day="3" month="1" year="1922">the 3rd of January 1922</st1:date>. He had
visited <st1:place>Dundee</st1:place> after being in Fraserburgh and had seen
God move in both places. These were very busy days for the young
evangelist.The past few months of
strenuous labour for the Master had left him exhausted. He had become hoarse
and was advised to refrain from public speaking for a period. During his
attendance at the meetings held in the Barrigol Hall it became obvious that his
presence brought inspiration into the services. However, when his throat showed
no improvement it was decided that surgery was necessary. This operation was
carried out in the <st1:place><st1:placename>Bignol</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
Wick. With loving care and attention Jock was soon his own self again.His return to the work was greeted with great
enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A special Gospel Rally was held in the
United Free Church. This was his first engagement since the operation.
Witnesses declare that it was a meeting "out of this world".The place was packed to capacity, chairs
filled the aisles and there were people sitting on the pulpit steps. His text for
that night was, "Ye must be born again." People who knew him in days
past had to recognise that he carried the seal of God's approval on his life
and work.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Jock now flung his whole weight
into the meetings. The rest had done him good, for the time he had been laid
aside proved to have brought fresh inspiration. So large were the crowds that
gathered to hear the local man that the police asked him to move from the
Market Place down to the harbour at. The Camps.Services were held between <st1:time hour="21" minute="0">9 p.m.</st1:time>
and <st1:time hour="23" minute="0">11 p.m.</st1:time> every night Jock also
preached in the Rifle Hall.It must have
been a great sight to watch him holding forth with his jacket off and his
sleeves rolled up. It was in the Zion Salvation Army Hall that he first introduced
the following hymn to his local townsfolk.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>"What
a wonderful change in my life has been wrought, <o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Since
Jesus came into my heart.<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>I
have peace in my soul for which long 1 have sought, <o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Since
Jesus came into my heart."<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Master's call was heavy upon Jock,
for it was not long before he started to travel. God's work in Wick went on,
with the tide continuing to rise in blessing. One notable feature was that the
young converts grasped every opportunity to witness for Christ. Jock made many
new friends among them. One of these was a young man who had been saved only a
few months earlier through the Pilgrim Preachers. From the beginning of his
Christian life this young man showed great promise, and he travelled with Jock
around <st1:place>Caithness</st1:place> holding meetings in halls and churches.
He told me that they were praying one night at 11.30.Jock said, "Angie, we must go out and
have an open-air." Although it was late they went into the Market Place
where they sang and preached.Doors and
windows were opened as people came to listen. It was a marvellous night. Men
and women collapsed in the street under the conviction of the Holy Spirit. As
Angie told me about that occasion in his home at Torry in <st1:city><st1:place>Aberdeen</st1:place></st1:city>,
my heart was amazed at the wonderful way in which God works. Tears were in his
eyes as he remembered souls lying in the gutters crying on Christ for mercy.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Jock found it hard to get away to
the quiet place. In a crowded home it was not easy to escape the publicity he
attracted. Often he would go down to the old sail-boats which were moored on
the river at Wick. There he cried alone to God in prayer. Sometimes Angie
joined him.In later years these days
became precious memories.Angie was later
to associate himself with the Open Brethren. For over fifty years he has proved
to be a faithful Bible teacher and evangelist.Many have found Christ through his ministry in the Brethren Assemblies,
especially in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Scotland</st1:place></st1:country-region>.I counted it a privilege to meet one who has
had the fire of God burning in his soul for nearly sixty years.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>Chapter 13<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>THURSO<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The town of <st1:city><st1:place>Thurso</st1:place></st1:city>
lies west of the well-known landmark of Dunnet Head.As in many other places at that time, the
spiritual temperature was low.One
bright spot was the Salvation Army which had been established around the turn of
the century.Thurso Salvation Army had
produced a young man by the name of Willie Leed, whom God used mightily in the
salvation of souls particularly in Portsoy, Banffshire in 1923.Willie Leed was converted in 1915.He was a signalman during the war, sailing
mainly in armed trawlers.He left Thurso
to become a Salvation Army Officer in 1919 and subsequently rose through the
ranks to become a Commisioner.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There were no herring drifters from
Thurso at <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city> in 1921.A few fishermen sailed on Wick boats.In one way it did not reap the benefit of
having boats return with crews of born again men.The winter herring fishing based at Thurso
and Scrabster from December to January drew boats from Wick and the <st1:place>Moray
 Firth</st1:place> ports.Many of the
men who came at that time had been converted at <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city>.They brought a breath of spiritual fire into
a corner which had not as yet been touched by the blessing that was flowing
amongst the fishing communities.When
they were not at sea, they made their way to the Salvation Army Hall at
Thurso.Ensign Hartington was the
officer in charge and proved to be a man "whose heart the Lord had
touched".Immediately he organised
these fishermen and used them at every opportunity.Special prayer meetings called "Knee
Drill" took place and open-air services were held.God began to move through these men for the
revival of Christians as well as the salvation of sinners.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One of the men converted in
December 1921 was John Sinclair, who became Sergeant-Major of the Thurso Corps.Mr.Sinclair took an active part in local government affairs, rising to the
highest office in that realm.It was in
these circumstances that he left his mark as a man who had high Christian
principles in dealing both with the poor and with royalty."The meetings were packed and the crowds
were so large that we were like herring in a barrel," he said."I went along to Army meetings on
Sundays, but had no real interest.One
weeknight I went along for Willie Leed' s brother, then I found myself being drawn
to the Army Hall.My friend refused to
enter, but I went in and got saved.Quite a few were at the Penitent Form that night.My friend Leed came along a few nights after
that and he got saved as well.At the
testimony meetings new converts would be anxious to tell in their own way how
they were saved and what progress they were making." Outside the Town Hall
at least 130 men and women stood in a ring.<st1:state><st1:place>Marches</st1:place></st1:state> of witness
attracted many as the fishermen, dressed in their jerseys, sang, "I'm not
ashamed to own my Lord." With great satisfaction he spoke of the words
facing the penitent sinner as he knelt at the "Mercy Seat" in the
Thurso Hall, "Jesus can save you now."They were painted by his friend Willie Leed,
the young Salvationist whom God was going to use throughout <st1:country-region><st1:place>Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in the rescue of perishing souls.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>Chapter 14<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>PORTSOY REVIVAL 1923<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Port soy on the Banffshire coast
knew something ~f delayed action regarding the evidence of the awakening of the
Spirit. Only a few men and women were converted at <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city>,
but they were genuine. God moved in 1923, there were people already prepared.
One such was George Currie. He had been a hard case before his.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">conversion, but when he found
Christ the change was remarkable. His entire family eventually became
Christians. Another was Jock "Tartan" Pirie. These two men were ready
to take responsibility when God moved two years later. One day while they were
praying for the town, two young Salvation Army officers, who were based in the
neighbouring <st1:place><st1:placetype>village</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>Cullen</st1:placename></st1:place>
came to Portsoy to do "Self Denial" collecting for Army funds. A
request was made for them to come to the village and hold meetings.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It was no coincidence that a
Captain Leed, who hailed from Thurso was the officer in charge of the Salvation
Army at Cullen. He was a member of the Army team who had seen tremendous
blessing around <st1:city><st1:place>Norwich</st1:place></st1:city> in <st1:country-region><st1:place>East
  Anglia</st1:place></st1:country-region> during 1921. In charge of the work
was the spiritual giant Albert Osborne, who was later to become General
Osborne. This young highlander was _ being prepared for the move of God in
Portsoy years before it took place.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Lieutenant Towns and his co-worker
realised that a few people in Portsoy were burdened over the spiritual state of
their town. The officers began to pray along with them. Captain Leed testified
that there were many occasions that Lieutenant Towns would weep all night for
Portsoy. One day the junior officer asked for permission to go to Portsoy to
conduct services. Immediately Captain Leed agreed. He had been praying that
his co-worker would volunteer to hold meetings in that town. It was a known
fact that many had boasted that Port soy was not touched by any revival.
Services were arranged to start during the week of <st1:date day="25" month="3" year="1923">25th March 1923</st1:date> in the form of open-air meetings at the
Shorehead and indoors at the Christian Insititute.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The open-air meeting took the usual
form of others conducted by the Salvation Army. There was bright singing and
testimonies from those who had come along with young Lieutenant Towns from
Cullen. He then gave a simple message. Crowds gathered to hear. A man who was
saved that night tells the story with great conviction. "I was just going
into my teens when I heard of the transforming power of Christ in the lives of
the men who returned from <st1:city><st1:place>Yarmouth</st1:place></st1:city>
in December 1921.Somehow Portsoy was
never the same. Every Saturday night at <st1:time hour="21" minute="0">9 p.m.</st1:time>
I would go to watch the drunks come out of the pub. The fights would be
tremendous with blood flowing from the hardened men as they fought fiercely
with each other.Fights also took place
at the Shorehead.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Little did some of these men
realise that a few months later they would be standing and testifying to the
power of Christ in the very same place. Why?Because Christ had come into their lives." </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The same brother goes on to tell of
that first meeting held in Portsoy on <st1:date day="25" month="3" year="1923">March
 25th 1923</st1:date>. "At the Shorehead open-air meeting after some songs
and testimonies, Lieutenant Towns went into the ring and spoke. · This is your
chance to get saved," he said. He then took off his jacket and laid it on
the ground. Then he fell on his knees and prayed. Immediately Alex Pirie, James
Slater and myself responded to the appeal before a great crowd who knew us
well. We openly got on our knees beside the young officer and trusted
Christ.Alex Pirie was later drowned in
the early days of the seine-net fishing on the <st1:place>Dogger Bank</st1:place>.
We were asked to testify for Christ right there and then at the Shorehead. Real
assurance entered my heart. We all then went to the Christian Institute where a
number got saved." The spiritual awakening had begun in Portsoy.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The services in the Christian
Institute were times of refreshing.Many
a night the hall would be packed to capacity with 500 people inside.The cinema was closed and later taken over by
the Salvation Army.People walked from
Whitehills, Fordyce, Sandend and Cullen to these meetings and there were many
conversions. A certain Jimmy Hay was drunk when he cried out, "Lord be
merciful to me a sinner." As he rose from his seat he was sober. It was
said that there were 400 souls saved in Portsoy and the surrounding villages at
that time.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There were some outstanding
conversions in Portsoy, but that of Jimmy Hay was a case of immediate
transformation. His brother tells of how the news was broken to Jimmy's mother.
"A neighbour cried out, 'Your Jimmy has got saved in Portsoy tonight.' I
cannot remember my mother's reply, but she stayed out of bed to see the result
of the work of grace. In due course Jimmy came home and cried out, 'Mither,
here's a new man tae ye the nicht.'My
mother stood for a moment and then sang,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>'Ring
the bells of heaven; there is joy today, <o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>For
a soul returning from the wild.<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>See,
the Father meets him out upon the way, <o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Welcoming
His weary, wandering child.' "<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The fishing <st1:place><st1:placetype>village</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Sandend</st1:placename></st1:place> was shaken to its
foundations that night. Jimmy Hay would often give his testimony at the
Shorehead in Portsoy.There crowds would
gather to hear what great things God had done.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>Chapter 15<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>JOCK TROUP<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Jock decided in 1922 that his Bible knowledge was limited
so he enrolled at the famous Bible Training Institute in <st1:address><st1:street>Bothwell
  Street</st1:street>, <st1:city>Glasgow</st1:city></st1:address>. At that time
the principal was Dr. David McIntyre and God used this intellectual servant of
His to mould the young evangelist.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Jock would constantly be having prayer meet­ings in his
room at all hours of the day and night, and although this created some problems
for Dr. McIntyre in his responsibility for the other students, the godly
principal used all his wisdom and knowledge in making Jock realise that rules
had to be kept. Some students testified that these times of prayer were a
tremendous blessing to their souls, and set them an examp le of how to pray
through and claim the blessing from heaven.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It was during these days that Jock met another young man
who was fired with the power of Christ. When that young man arrived at the
Bible Training Institute, he hardly knew how to use a fork and knife. Peter
Connolly was born and brought up a Roman Catholic in a poor home in the North
of England. From the moment he was saved his life began to speak volumes for
the power of salvation. Soon a bond of love, unity and desire to work for
Christ grew between these two and they were con­stantly called upon to conduct
campaigns together during college days. Both of them found the discipline. hard
at the Institute, yet later on they often paid tribute to the help and
encouragement they received. On one occasion Jock and Peter complained about a
certain lecturer who had not mentioned Jesus Christ in his lecture. The prin­cipal
asked for their notes and they told him that they had disposed of them. He took
time and patience to explain to his two over zealous students that the lecture
had been on the Children of Israel in the Wilderness. Travelling together in
gospel campaigns around <st1:country-region><st1:place>Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
they won many for Christ. They would spend days and nights in prayer, even
fasting when the heavens seemed as brass, with no one professing conversion.
Tears would be shed as these men bound the enemy of souls, laying hold on the
Word of God that declares, "Whatsoever ye bind on earth, it shall be bound
in heaven." The two warriors knew that the secret of blessing was based in
powerful praying. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In many fishing towns along the Scottish coast there are
still those who remember missions being conducted by Peter and Jock. Over the
next years they travelled exten­sively. In 1932 Jock was invited to become
Assistant Superintendent to Mr. P. T. McRostie at the Tent Hall in <st1:city><st1:place>Glasgow</st1:place></st1:city>.
The Tent Hall was situated in the Saltmarket part of <st1:city><st1:place>Glasgow</st1:place></st1:city>.
It was built after Moody and Sankey held their cam­paigns in the city. Since
then it had been a centre of evangelism. This new ministry in a more settled
sphere provided Jock with a fresh challenge which he met with the help of the
Lord. Jock by this time had found a help-mate who hailed from Wick.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Mr. McRostie died in 1933 and Jock was asked to take full
responsibility for the work at the famous Tent Hall. At that time it was one of
the largest independent missions in the land. He accepted the challenge and was
Superintendent until 1945. During those years Jock fought against every evil
that abounded in the city of <st1:city><st1:place>Glasgow</st1:place></st1:city>.
The war years were used as an opportunity to bring the gospel to the armed
forces and supply weary travellers with meals. No doubt Jock's mind would go
back to <st1:city><st1:place>Dublin</st1:place></st1:city> during the 1914-18
war, when Mr. &amp; Mrs. West provided similar facilities which were
instrumental in bringing him to Christ.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">His open-air services at the Glasgow Cross were blessed
times when his tremendous voice could be heard singing and preaching ever
Saturday afternoon. He made sure that his meetings were always bright, whether
it was out in campaigns or in the more organised atmosphere of the Tent Hall.
One of his saying was, "There is no warrant in Scripture to tell us that a
gospel service should be conducted like a funeral."In Tent Hall days Jock invited many powerful
ministers and evangelists to <st1:city><st1:place>Glasgow</st1:place></st1:city>
for special meetings. Men like the well-known Bible expositor Donald Barnhouse.
The evangelist W. P. Nicholson came and his ministry was blessed by the
salvation of souls.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Jock never lost the urge to travel in order to preach the
gospel. He had realised earlier on that he was called to be an evangelist and
never lost that sense of call. However, the years had taken their toll on his
health and after some ill­ness he resigned from the leadership of the Tent Hall
in 1945. Many folks speak yet of those days, and there are many who are proud
to have been associated with him in the work of the Gospel. He never lost his
love for the Salvation Army. During his frequent visits to Wick he always vis­ited
the Corps there. He took great delight in appealing for funds for the Salvation
Army picnic for children in Wick. In the open-air at the Camps in Wick he would
cry out for all those who could afford to give £1 notes, then for those who
were able to give 10/- notes and last of all he would ask for the snow (silver)
to cover the paper.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When a Wick Salvationist was being interviewed as a
candidate for Officership by Commissioner Jeffries he was asked, "Do you
know a John Troup?" "I know a Jock Troup," replied the
candidate. ''Well," said the Commissioner,. "I in­vited him to become
an officer in the Salvation Army, but he felt he could not stand the discip­line.Jock is reported to have said at least once,
"If 1 had my life to live over again, I would be a Salvation Army
Officer."<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After Jock's health began to improve, he start­ed to
travel again and conduct missions throughout <st1:country-region><st1:place>Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region>.He also went abroad.In <st1:country-region><st1:place>America</st1:place></st1:country-region>
he was greatly loved as an old-fashioned Gospel preacher. Many souls were saved
in the camp­aigns he held across that vast continent. It was on one of these
tours that he received his call to "higher service". At the
commencement of a campaign in <st1:state><st1:place>Washington</st1:place></st1:state>,
which was to last six days, he had just started his message, gave out his text
saying, "What else can I say but ye must be born again?" At that
moment he passed from time into the immediate presence of the Master he served
and loved. From that night in 1918 in the wheelhouse of the drifter Strombo,
until he went home to glory on <st1:date day="18" month="4" year="1954">the
 18th of April 1954</st1:date>, the Christ Who saved him, kept him in every
battle and trial. God took His servant home to heaven with his "boots
on", preaching the old Gospel he loved and defended. Often in conversation
with his dear wife he had declared that he wished to pass on whilst on active
service. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Jock was not an old man, but the thirty-six years of
Christian experience were packed to cap­acity .in the service of Christ. Truly
he could say, "I, love my Master, I will not go out free."He has gone down in the annals of the <st1:place><st1:placename>Evangelical</st1:placename>
<st1:placetype>Church</st1:placetype></st1:place> as one of the greatest
evangelists <st1:country-region><st1:place>Scotland</st1:place></st1:country-region>
has ever produced. It was his responsibility and privilege to be one of the few
men entrusted to be at the "helm" in a time of spiritual awakening.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One of Jock's favourite choruses was, .<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>"Just a little longer, and the trump of
God will sound,<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Just a little longer, and we'll all
be glory bound.<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Look away to Jesus, your redemption
draweth nigh ,.­<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Just a little longer, and we'll meet
Him in the sky."<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">His melodious voice has been preserved for posterity on
quite a few gramophone records. He sang the old hymns' with a "tremendous
depth of conviction seldom found in modern gospel soloists.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Many of the renowned evangelical leaders paid tribute to
Jock and lamented that a great man and a prince had "fallen in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>".
His lifetime friend Peter Connely said when he heard of Jock's untimely death,
"I have lost my dearest friend. He wept long and uncontrollably for the
souls of men and women that his eyes were like balls of fire. He taught me how
to pray."<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The

Awakening 1921-23, and I do so hoping that our faith may be strengthened that
the "God Who lived at Pentecost is just the same today'" Why not a
world-wide revival in our time?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">My title
is borrowed from Commissioner Brengle and his observations of God strateg­ically
using human events to accomplish His purposes for the salvation of mankind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Surely
Divine strategy arranged three independent spiritual spearheads to simultan­eously
attack </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">East Anglia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span lang="EN-GB"> in 1921 with wide­ reaching results. Rev.
Douglas Brown was mightily used of God in Lowestoft and surrounding area; in
Yarmouth, Jock Troup, Scottish evangelist, then a Salvationist, was conducting
spare-time warfare on theatre and cinema queues, also pub closing-time crowds,
winning many souls; while Staff-captain Albert Osborn and Staff­ captain Gordon
Simpson S.F.T. at Clapton, were undoubtedly divinely directed' to arrange a
Charabanc Crusade comprising Training Officers and Sergeants (I was fortunate
to be a member) in widely scattered East Anglia, which brought to Christ a
multitude of souls - 106 in Norwich alone. Towns and villages were invaded by
Crusadets, morning, </span><st1:time hour="12" minute="0"><span lang="EN-GB">noon</span></st1:time><span lang="EN-GB"> and nights, with outstanding response.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">I believe
God's strategy with those events was aimed at far wider issues, for the annual
invasion of the fishing ports by thous­ands of Scottish fishworkers happened
when Revival was getting into its stride. Douglas Brown had prolonged his
Campaign, all places of worship being thronged with seeking souls, great
numbers of Scots among them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The
fishing season ended, the Scots carried the Revival Fire north and North
Scottish towns and villages were aflame, converts "went everywhere
preaching the Lord Jesus", thousands being saved. At Peterhead 600 seekers
were registered, and Wick Corps saw at least 500, and great numbers of professing
Christians were revived; practically all denominations pulsated with new life,
and eager converts carried the Gospel to their neighbouring villages. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">At
Cullen, outpost of Findochty, Lieutenant Reg. Woods (late Commissioner), led
some little girls to Jesus and told them to ask their mothers to pray for them.
Golden haired Anna Gardiner did so, and her war-widowed mother, stricken to the
heart, replied, "My quinie (wee girl) I canna' pray for masel' yet'"
Said Anna, "Mither, ye can be saved. too!" That was a troubled night
for Mrs. Gardiner, and it was no co-incidence led Lieutenant Woods to bring a
group of converts for an open-air next day almost outside her door. Mrs.
Gardiner left her washtub, arms full of soap-suds, and standing in the ring with
uplifted hands cried, "I want you all to know I accept Jesus Christ as my
Saviour!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Her
witness electrified Cullen Seatown; the Lieutenant announced a meeting in the
hall which was filled, and that afternoon a soul ­saving work began that never
ceased until very many converts were won.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A few
months later my Lieutenant (Col. Albert Towns) and I were appointed from
Clapton to. Cullen. These wonderful days - crowded meetings in the hall which
was filled, and that meetings weekdays and Sunday - 24 meetings weekly outdoors
and inside including Y.P. - great enthusiasm - everyone anxious to<i> </i>pray,
sing and testify. Our first open-air comprised eighty in the ring, and I felt
"surely God is in this place!" That was the night of our arrival and
that impression never left me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">To
organise the Corps was a glad responsibility, but we were anxious to win souls,
but this was difficult - everyone seemed already saved. The D.C. reminded us
there was a time for ingathering and a time for building them up in our most
holy faith.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">1922 was
a wonderful year.To<i> </i>watch these
newly-born Christ­ians grow in grace and in the knowledge of Christ was an
inspirat­ion.It did much for
ourselves also. A Training Officer had<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">advised
me to give my very best in my first address and to improve on that standard in
every meeting following. He little realised what he was laying upon me. We had
eleven senior meetings weekly besides five Y.P. meetings and ten open-airs,
besides constant visitation.We had
to wrestle in prayer.Certain sects challenged
the converts on Army doctrine, which made us search the Scriptures even more
thoroughly than when in training, but this confirmed our confidence in the
Scriptural foundations of our movement. After a lifetime of prayerful
consideration of "the faith which was once delivered to<i> </i>the
saints", my convictions thereon are deeper than ever.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Somehow,
despite seeming improbability of another great ingather­ing of souls, we
believed we would again see God's hand mightily at work. For our New Year motto
we chose General Osborn's song "Greater Things", and in our
Watchnight Service issued a challenge. After much prayer we asked all who
believed the coming year would show "even greater things" to<i> </i>sing
the chorus with uplifted hands. I see them now - the packed hal1 - uplifted
faces, same tear-stained - hands outstretched to<i> </i>God - a sublime moment
of childlike faith in God. We little realised how it should come - another
Great Awakening.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-GB">Portsoy,</span></b><span lang="EN-GB"> one-time busy little sea part, six miles east
of<i> </i>Cullen, was our responsibility. We more than once held a two-man
open-air there, but there seemed little interest. We were later told the folk
prided themselves that in former times when revival swept the coast Portsoy
remained untouched. Duncan Mathiesan and James Turner were reputed to<i> </i>have
laboured there in vain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Delivering
SD envelopes there early in 1923 I was twice chall­enged;a woman told me Portsoy could go to hel1 for
all the Christians cared, and an elderly fisherman implored me to hold meetings
there. Deeply concerned, while cycling home that day, I felt a distinct urge
that something must be done. But how? Our Cul1en itinerary was heavy. Owing to
a clause in letting of the hall, we dared not close it for one night. Others
were keen to use it, and once they got in we would be on the streets.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">On the
following Tuesday, however, we arranged for someone to hold the fort at Cullin
whilst a party of us invaded Portsoy where a hall was engaged for a
meeting.At the preceding open-air a
young man knelt in the ring causing a sensation. The hall was crowded. There
was obvious conviction, but none came forward indoors.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Next
Sunday a young Portsoy man came to Cullen and claimed Salvation. Begging me to
come to Portsoy for a Sunday meeting, he said many there were under conviction
and he was sure they would respond. Again local difficulties confronted us, but
I asked the Lord if this was of Him would He cause the Lieutenant to offer to
go with a. party. To my joy, walking home that night the Lieutenant said,
"Let me go with some of the fellows, Captain." I immediately secured
the hall and announced the meeting. Next Sunday we turned our Cullen services
into prayer meetings for Portsoy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">During
one night meeting I was distinctly convinced souls were surrendering at Portsoy
. Later I met the Lieutenant on the road home and said, "Before you tell
me anything, you have had souls."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"Yes,"
he replied, "three young men came forwards in the open-air, and six more
men indoors."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"Thank
God," I answered. "Now you will return tomorrow and others will
follow." One of the party said later, "You often speak about the Holy
Spirit, Captain. I saw Him at work in the Lieutenant in that open-air. He was
truly filled with the Holy Ghost!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Next day
six young men surrendered. God now wonderfully helped with arrangements for our
Cullen meetings, and we had nine­teen seekers at Portsoy on Tuesday. On
Wednesday the D.C. came. We engaged the Town Hall and twenty-six souls were
registered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">And so it
went on; the Town Hall was packed nightly, floor and gallery, many unable to
gain admittance. Often folks were at the penitent-form before the meeting
commenced as the people gathered long before commencing time, singing and
praising God.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">There
were so few to help us with the penitents, we frequently had to leave the
prayer meeting to run itself. Eighty year old grannie Pirie, olden-times
Salvationist kept things goin'. I see her now walking the aisle singing,
"There are angels hovering round ­to carry the tidings home."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The town
seemed transformed; one somehow felt spiritual atmos­phere everywhere; the
glory of the Lord seemed upon the place. Singing could be heard from the houses
as converts gathered to praise God everywhere. I recall a wonderful occasion
when an elderly lady pulled me from the street into her home, saying,
"Pray wi' me, Captain; I want tae mak' ma peace wi' God!" her kitchen
table became a hallowed altar. Many were pointed to Christ in their homes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">One
memorable night when a hefty R.C. lady came to the Mercy­ seat a young woman
rushed forward embracing her. Enquiring later, I found the girl was her niece.
There was bitter estrangement between the families - family dispute - violence
- the lady had broken her brother's arm. For twenty years they had not spoken
to one another. Two years later I saw both families walking to the Holiness
Meeting with Bibles under their arms. "What a wonderful change in their
lives had been wrought since Jesus came into their hearts."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The
elderly fisherman and his wife who first challenged me, were converted and
their home became the first Corps quarters. The lady challenger of that day
also came to the Lord. Later she became the Home League Secretary. Her husband
was a wonderful trophy of grace. Sixteen years afterwards he thumped me on the
back when I briefly visited the town, saying, "Captain Leed you are my
spirit­ual father!" I was deeply moved as I also was that day on visiting
a grand soul who at conversion was unable to read owing to unfortunate
circumstances in childhood. She learned to read in order to understand the
Bible and Song Book.Greeting me with
her Song Book in her hand she joyfully said, "Oh Captain, listen tae this
lovely sonie I've jist been readinAs
she read a thrill of joy came over me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">There was
no great preaching, just a simple presentation of the Gospel with earnest
appeals to yield to Christ. Sometimes no address was given, seekers came to the
penitent form as soon as the meetings commenced. An outstanding feature was
that the large proportion of elderly folk who were saved - aged married couples
particularly, and faithful Christians they became. There was no undue excite­ment,
they not being an over-emotional type. Prior to the Awakening it seemed a
spiritually indifferent town. .<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Lack of
space prevents further reminiscences but many times I have thanked God for the
gracious privilege of sharing in that wonderful work of grace, for a lifetime
friendship with my Lieutenant of those great days, and the memories of those
converts the majority of whom are now in the Gloryland.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"The prairie fire of religious revival is raging along the coasts from
Wick to Peterhead. It was kindled by a torch lit at </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Yarmouth</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> and </span><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Lowestoft</span></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">. It is filling the Kirks and
emptying the pubs. 'We came back with nae muckle siller, but with saved souls,'
is the frequent remark made. Is there any new message? 1 asked. 'No, just the
old, old story, but the preaching has power.' They speak affectionately of Jock
and </span><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Douglas</span></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB"> meaning their leaders. Jock Troup a
herring cooper from Wick and the Rev. A. Douglas Brown a Baptist minister from </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">London</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB">. While having dinner one Sunday aboard
a herring drifter Jock Troup said, 'We're going to have a revival, we must pray
and then go out and get it.' This they did, they knelt on the floor of the
cabin and cried to God, then went ashore and held the first of many open-air
meetings in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Yarmouth</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB">. It is obvious that PRAYER AND CONFIDENCE ARE
THE WEAPONS WITH WHICH THIS </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">BATTLE</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> IS BEING FOUGHT.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Meetings started in the open-air, then the churches opened their door
and hundreds professed salvation. 'It won't last long,' they said, but the
fisherfolks are home from </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">East Anglia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span lang="EN-GB"> and in every port they are
spreading the message. The churches have been revived. It is indeed for the <i>Noel

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"People are thronging the streets going to Church, nine out of ten
can be counted on being bound for a place of worship. They are not the
conventional type of Churchgoer. With them religion is part of themselves, not
to be confused with the donning of fine raiment. So one discovers them in the
garb of their calling, the men in blue jerseys and caps, the women in shawls,
but there are well-dressed people sprinkled amongst them, which shows that the
movement is not confined to only the fisher class. Where the church should hold
500, a 1000 or more contrive to find an entry and the doorway is blocked with
others who would fain get in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">There is no waiting .for the fixed hour for the beginning. Prayer is
offered spontaneously -without a break, the worship switches again into hymn
choruses. Voluntary testimonies are frankly and eagerly made by young
converts." Tales of drink and gambling, of domestic unhappiness, of soured
existence, flow from the lips of men and women who passionately" plead
with the unconverted. The messages are simple. there is insistence on one point
- the acceptance of Christ as the only road to salvation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Figures in tens and twenties move down the aisles of places of worship
to prostrate themselves at the stool of repentance. More come to increase the number
of motionless figures at the front. It is an experience that sends a thrill
through you veins. The people refuse to leave the building, and once more the
singing breaks out, as full-throated as ever.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The villages along the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span lang="EN-GB">Moray</span></st1:placename><st1:placetype><span lang="EN-GB">Coast</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB"> are moved by the revival. Each
centre is sending out groups of God-fearing sturdy fishermen as day
missionaries to the immediate neighbourhood, which in turn follows the same
course. By cycle and foot without regard to weather they make their pilgrimage.
They are triumphant heroes of the Cross of Christ with its meaning and message.
Everywhere at home and in the streets there is joyous singing of hymns such as
. At the cross where I first saw the Light'.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">'We are not revolting against the churches', says Jock 'But the Almighty
is.' The ministers have left the Bible to a new theology which is not based on
the Bible. God has lowly and humble instruments .to .guide people back to the
truth which is in Christ. It is a revelation to hear the songs sung in the
Spirit."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"There are I believe deeper truths in this revival movement than
meets the eye of the casual observer for men and women, young and old have been
swept off their feet in 1000' s as the movement has swept up the seaboard of
the Aberdeenshire Coast. Life has been radically changed, and the old
valuations are gone. Something big and overwhelming has happened to them, and
we stand by and gaze wonderingly and perhaps half CONTEMPTUOUSLY at the
PHENOMENON<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">and ask ourselves, 'What is it, what is the power that has changed our
ordinary PLACID and quiet living neighbours into praising, praying, prophesying
evangelists?' I have met them personally and collectively and can say it is not
EMOTION. One thing has impress­ed me and that is that the gatherings are mostly
acts of praise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

success with many wonderful conversions taking place. Several fish­ermen
converts have left for West Coast fishing. On boat, the Mizpah is manned
entirely by men who have professed Christianity, and their departure last week
for the Stornoway fishing was a scene of great interest at the harbour. The
boat sailed with the Salvat­ion Army flag flying from her masthead and the crew
and their friends sang revival hymns. It was really a scene unexampled in the

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"David Cordiner does not mention his experiences at Peterhead very
often - he is afraid lest people think he is a somebody, when he knows, 'Jesus
did it all'. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">He was in the fishing fleet at </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Yarmouth</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> along with Jock Troup when the
revival broke out there. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">He had to bear the hardships of the poor fishing that was exper­ienced
when the fleet went out day after day and often returned with hardly a fish.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Jock Troup heard the voice of God in the trouble and began open-air
meetings, at which David stood as a listener. David had been converted some two
years previously, but had never come right out for God. One night, however, he
faced the matter, and he felt within him a great deliverance had come. Now he
could take part in the meetings, and began by bringing his mates and the
fishergirls to the meetings, and many were saved. Soon the boats turned home
once more to </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Scotland</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span lang="EN-GB">, and when he reached Peterhead, and
went home to his father's house, he felt a heavy burden of responsibility upon
his soul.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">One Saturday night he was compelled to go along to the corner where the men
usually gathered. He had never preached before, and had neither heads nor tails
to his address; but the Lord filled his mouth with words, and soon a crowd
gathered. For nearly two hours David held on his burning appeal. That night
seven men came out and knelt down on the stones of the street, confessing their
sin and committing themselves to the Saviour. Next day, Sunday, was a day
usually spent mostly in prayer. When night came, he went forth again to the
street, and again a crowd gather­ed. The night was cold, and after a time a
march was formed, and the crowd went into the Salvation Army Hall. Here a great
scene was witnessed, when over twenty anxious souls sought the Saviour.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">For six weeks meetings went on every night, David bearing the greater
share of the work, but others also came to help, and hun­dreds professed
decision for Christ. Some news of this movement reached us in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Glasgow</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB">, and on the first Saturday of the
New Year of 1922, I went to </span><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Falkirk</span></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB"> for the weekend, to help Mr. Currie, of the
Town Mission, who was Chairman of our Newton St. Boswells Branch at one time.
At Larbert I met a friend who said to me, 'Have you heard that David Cordiner
has come to </span><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Falkirk</span></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">?' I said, 'No.' 'Well he is to take
part in the meetings at the Town Mission this weekend.' I was delighted to hear
it, and went on the </span><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Falkirk</span></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB"> with keen expectations. Mr. Currie met me, and told me about David
Cordiner's arrival, and that he had come without being asked, and<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">that, whilst he would take part in the meetings, I must also take part.
We went to the Mission Hall and knelt down in the vestry to pray. While we were
kneeling, the door opened, and someone knelt<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">down near me, and I knew it was David Cordiner. When we got up from our
knees, I shook hands with this serious-faced young man. I said, 'You will take
the meeting tonight?' 'No, you must fulfil your programme,' he said."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
