<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>THE
IMPORTANCE OF PRAYER <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>In
the 6th chapter of Ephesians in the 18th verse we read words which put the
tremendous importance of prayer with startling and overwhelming force: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>"Praying always with all prayer and supplication in
the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for
all saints."</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>When
we stop to weigh the meaning of these words, <span class="GramE">then</span> note
the connection in which they are found, the intelligent child of God is driven
to say, "I must pray, pray, pray. I must put all my energy and all my
heart into prayer. Whatever else I do, I must pray." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>The
Revised Version is, if possible, stronger than the Authorized: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>"With
all prayer and supplication praying at all seasons in the spirit, and watching
thereunto in all perseverance and supplication for all the saints." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Note
the ALLS: "with ALL prayer," "at ALL seasons," "in ALL
perseverance," "for ALL the saints." Note the piling up of
strong words, "prayer," "supplication,"
"perseverance." Note once more the strong expression, "watching
thereunto," more literally, "being sleepless thereunto." Paul
realized the natural slothfulness of man, and especially his natural
slothfulness in prayer. How seldom we pray things through! How often the church
and the individual get right up to the verge of a great blessing in prayer and
just then let go, get drowsy, quit. I wish that these words "being
sleepless unto prayer" might burn into our hearts. I wish the whole verse
might burn into our hearts. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>But
why is this constant, persistent, sleepless, overcoming prayer so needful? <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>1.
First of all, BECAUSE THERE IS A DEVIL. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>He
is cunning, he is mighty, he never rests, he is ever plotting the downfall of
the child of God; and if the child of God relaxes in prayer, the devil will
succeed in ensnaring him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>This
is the thought of the context. The 12th verse reads: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>"For
our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities,
against the powers, against the world rulers of this darkness, against the
spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places." <span class="GramE">(R.V.)</span>
Then comes the 13th verse: "Wherefore take up the <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>whole</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> <span class="SpellE">armor</span> of God,
that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, having done all, to
stand." <span class="GramE">(R.V.)</span> Next follows a description of the
different parts of the Christian's <span class="SpellE">armor</span>, which we
are to put on if we are to stand against the devil and his mighty wiles. Then
Paul brings all to a climax in the 18th verse, telling us that to all else we
must add prayer -- constant, persistent, untiring, sleepless prayer in the Holy
Spirit, or all else will go for nothing. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>2.
A second reason for this constant, persistent, sleepless, overcoming prayer is
that PRAYER IS GOD'S APPOINTED WAY FOR OBTAINING THINGS, AND THE GREAT SECRET OF
ALL LACK IN OUR EXPERIENCE, <span class="GramE">IN</span> OUR LIFE AND IN OUR
WORK IS NEGLECT OF PRAYER. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>James
brings this out very forcibly in the 4th chapter and 2nd verse of his epistle:
"Ye have not because you ask not." These words contain the secret of
the poverty and powerlessness of the average Christian -- neglect of prayer. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>"Why
is it," many a Christian is asking, "I make so little progress in my
Christian life?" <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>"Neglect
of prayer," God answers. "You have not because you ask not." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>"Why
is it," many a minister is asking, "I see so little fruit from my <span class="SpellE">labors</span>?" <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Again
God answers, "Neglect of prayer. You have not because you ask not." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>"Why
is it," many a Sunday-School teacher is asking, "that I see so few
converted in my Sunday-School class?" <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4" style="page-break-before:always"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Still God answers, "Neglect of prayer.
You have not because you ask not." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>"Why
is it," both ministers and churches are asking, "that the church of
Christ makes so little headway against unbelief and error and sin and
worldliness?" <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Once
more we hear God answering, "Neglect of prayer. You have not because you
ask not." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>3.
The third reason for this constant, persistent, sleepless, overcoming prayer is
that THOSE MEN WHOM GOD SET FORTH AS A PATTERN OF WHAT HE EXPECTED CHRISTIANS
TO BE -- THE APOSTLES -- REGARDED PRAYER AS THE MOST IMPORTANT BUSINESS OF
THEIR LIVES. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>When
the multiplying responsibilities of the early church crowded in upon them, they
"called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, <span class="GramE">It</span> is not reason that we should leave the Word of God, and
serve tables. Wherefore, brethren, look you out among <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>you</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> seven men of honest report, full of the
Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business. But WE WILL GIVE
OURSELVES CONTINUALLY TO PRAYER and to the ministry of the Word." It is
evident from what Paul wrote to the churches and to individuals about praying
for them, that very much of his time and strength and thought was given to
prayer. (Rom. 1:9, R.V.; Eph. 1:15<span class="GramE">,16</span>; Col. 1:9, R.V.;
1_Thess. 3:10; 2_Tim. 1:3, R.V.) <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>All
the mighty men of God outside the Bible have been men of prayer. They have
differed from one another in many things, but in this they have been alike. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>4.
But there is a still weightier reason for this constant, persistent, sleepless,
overcoming prayer. It is, PRAYER OCCUPIED A VERY PROMINENT PLACE AND PLAYED A
VERY IMPORTANT PART IN THE EARTHLY LIFE OF OUR LORD. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Turn,
for example, to Mark 1:35. We read, "And in the morning, rising up a great
while before day, He went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there
prayed." The preceding day had been a very busy and exciting one, but
Jesus shortened the <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>hours</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> of needed sleep that He might arise early
and give Himself to more sorely needed prayer. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Turn
again to Luke 6:12, where we read, "And it came to pass in those days that
He went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to
God." Our <span class="SpellE">Savior</span> found it necessary on occasion
to take a whole night for prayer. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>The
words "pray" and "prayer" are used at least twenty-five
times in connection with our Lord in the brief record of His life in the four
Gospels, and His praying is mentioned in places where the words are not used.
Evidently prayer took much of the time and <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>strength</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> of Jesus, and a man or woman who does not
spend much time in prayer, cannot properly be called a follower of Jesus
Christ. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>5.
There is another reason for constant, persistent, sleepless, overcoming prayer
that seems if possible even more <span class="GramE">forcible</span> than this,
namely, PRAYING IS <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4" style="page-break-before:always"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>THE MOST IMPORTANT
PART OF THE PRESENT MINISTRY OF OUR RISEN LORD.</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Christ's
ministry did not close with His death. His atoning work was finished then, but
when He rose and ascended to the right hand of the Father, He entered upon
other work for us just as important in its place as His atoning work. It cannot
be divorced <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>from</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> His atoning work; it rests upon that as its
basis, but it is necessary to our complete salvation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>What
that great present work is, by which He carries our salvation on to
completeness, we read in Heb. 7:25, "Wherefore He is able also to save
them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing HE EVER LIVETH TO MAKE
INTERCESSION FOR THEM." This verse tells us that Jesus is able to save us
unto the uttermost, not merely FROM the uttermost, but UNTO the uttermost, unto
entire <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>completeness</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>, absolute perfection, because He not merely
died, but because He also "ever <span class="SpellE">liveth</span>."
The verse also tells us for what purpose He now lives, "TO MAKE
INTERCESSION FOR US," to pray. Praying is the principal thing He is doing
in these days. It is by His prayers that He is saving us. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>The
same thought is found in Paul's remarkable, triumphant challenge in Rom. 8:34
-- "Who is he that shall condemn? It is Christ Jesus that died, yea
rather, that was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, WHO ALSO
MAKETH INTERCESSION FOR US." <span class="GramE">(R.V.)</span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>If
we then are to have fellowship with Jesus Christ in His present work, we must
spend much time in prayer; we must give ourselves to earnest, constant,
persistent, sleepless, overcoming prayer. I know of nothing that has so
impressed me with a sense of the importance of praying at all seasons, being
much and constantly in prayer, as the thought that that is the principal
occupation at present of my risen Lord. I want to have fellowship with Him, and
to that end I have asked the Father that whatever else He may make me, to make
me at all events an intercessor, to make me a man who knows how to pray, and
who spends much time in prayer. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>This
ministry of intercession is a glorious and a mighty ministry, and we can all have
part in it. The man or the woman who is shut away from the public meeting by
sickness can have part in it; the busy mother; the woman who has to take in
washing for a <o:p></o:p></span></p>

The sixth reason for constant, persistent, sleepless, overcoming prayer is that
PRAYER IS THE MEANS THAT GOD HAS APPOINTED FOR OUR RECEIVING MERCY, AND
OBTAINING GRACE TO HELP IN TIME OF NEED. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Heb.
4:16 is one of the simplest and sweetest verses in the Bible, -- "Let us
therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4" style="page-break-before:always"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>find</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> grace to help in
time of need." These words make it very plain that God has appointed a way
by which we shall seek and obtain mercy and grace. That way is prayer; bold,
confident, outspoken approach to the throne of grace, the most holy place of
God's presence, where our sympathizing High Priest, Jesus Christ, has entered
in our behalf. <span class="GramE">(Verses 14, 15.)</span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Mercy
is what we need, grace is what we must have, or all our life and effort will
end in complete failure. Prayer is the way to get them. There is infinite grace
at our disposal, and we make it ours experimentally by prayer. Oh, if we only
realized the <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> of God's grace, that is ours for the
asking, its height and depth and length and breadth, I am sure that we would
spend more time in prayer. The measure of our appropriation of grace is
determined by the measure of our prayers. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Who
is there that does not feel that he needs more grace? Then ask for it. Be
constant and persistent in your asking. Be importunate and untiring in your
asking. God delights to have us "shameless" beggars in this
direction; for it shows our faith in <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Him,
and He is mightily pleased with faith. Because of our "shamelessness"
He will rise and give us as much as we need (Luke 11:8). What little streams of
mercy and grace most of us know, when we might know rivers overflowing their
banks! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

The next reason for constant, persistent, sleepless, overcoming prayer is that
PRAYER IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST IS THE WAY JESUS CHRIST HIMSELF HAS
APPOINTED FOR HIS DISCIPLES TO OBTAIN FULLNESS OF JOY. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

states this simply and beautifully in John 16:24, "Hitherto have you asked
nothing in <span class="GramE">My</span> name; ask, and you shall receive, that
your joy may be fulfilled." "Made full" is the way the Revised
Version reads. Who is there that does not wish his joy filled full? Well, the
way to have it filled full is by praying in the name of Jesus. We all know
people whose joy is filled full, indeed, it is just running over, is shining
from their eyes, bubbling out of their very lips, and running off their finger
tips when they shake hands with you. Coming in contact with them is like coming
in contact with an electrical machine charged with gladness. Now people of that
sort are always people that spend much time in prayer. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Why
<span class="GramE">is it</span> that prayer in the name of Christ brings such
fullness of joy? <span class="GramE">In part, because we get what we ask.</span>
But that is not the only reason, nor the greatest. It makes God real. When we
ask something definite of God, and He gives it, how real God <o:p></o:p></span></p>

God who is real, and not merely an idea. I remember how once I was taken
suddenly and seriously sick all alone in my study. I dropped upon my knees and
cried to God for help. Instantly all pain left me -- I <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> perfectly well. It seemed as if God stood
right there, and had put out His hand and touched me. The joy of the healing
was not <span class="GramE">so</span> great as the joy of meeting God. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>There
is no greater joy on earth or in heaven, than communion with God, and prayer in

The eighth reason for constant, persistent, sleepless, overcoming prayer is
that PRAYER, IN EVERY CARE AND ANXIETY AND NEED OF LIFE, WITH THANKSGIVING, IS
THE MEANS THAT GOD HAS APPOINTED FOR OBTAINING FREEDOM FROM ALL ANXIETY, <span class="GramE">AND</span> THE PEACE OF GOD WHICH PASSETH ALL UNDERSTANDING. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

careful for nothing," says Paul, "but in everything by prayer and
supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God, and

(Phil. 4:6<span class="GramE">,7</span>.) To many this seems at the first glance,
the picture of a life that is beautiful, but beyond the reach of ordinary
mortals; not so at all. The verse tells us how the life is attainable by every
child of God: "Be careful for nothing," or as the Revised Version
reads, "In nothing be anxious." The remainder of the verse tells us
how, and it is very simple: "But in everything by prayer and supplication
with thanksgiving let your requests <span class="GramE">be</span> made known unto
God." What could be plainer or <span class="GramE">more simple</span> than

The ninth reason for constant, persistent, sleepless, overcoming prayer is that

many have received the Holy Spirit the moment of their surrender to God before

fell so manifestly, and the whole place was so filled with His presence, that
no one could speak or pray, but sobs of joy filled the place. Men went out of
that room to different parts of the country, taking trains that very morning,
and reports soon came back of the out-pouring of God's Holy Spirit in answer to
prayer. Others went out into the city with the blessing of God upon them. This

<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>One
of the most interesting and solemn passages upon prayer in the Bible is along
this line. (Luke 21:34-36) "Take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your
hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness and cares of this life,
and so <span class="GramE">that day come</span> upon you unawares. For as a snare
shall it come on all them that dwell in the face of the whole <span class="GramE">earth.</span> Watch you therefore, and PRAY ALWAYS, that you may be
accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to
stand before the Son of man." According to this passage there is only one
way in which we can be prepared for the coming of the Lord when He appears,
that is, through much prayer. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>The
coming again of Jesus Christ is a subject that is awakening much interest and
much discussion in our day; but it is one thing to be interested in the Lord's
return, and to talk about it, and quite another thing to be prepared for it. We
live in an atmosphere that has a constant tendency to unfit us for Christ's
coming. The world tends to draw us down by its gratifications and by its cares.
There is only one way by which we can rise triumphant above these things--by
constant watching unto prayer, that is, by sleeplessness unto prayer.
"Watch" in this passage is the same strong word used in Eph. 6:18,
and "always" the same strong phrase "in every season." The
man who spends little time in prayer, who is not steadfast and constant in
prayer, will not be ready for the Lord when He comes. But we may be ready. How?
Pray! Pray! Pray! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

There is one more reason for constant, persistent, sleepless, overcoming
prayer, and it is a mighty one: BECAUSE OF WHAT PRAYER ACCOMPLISHES. Much has
really been said upon that already, but there is much also that should be added.

<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>It
is through prayer that my sin is brought to light, my most hidden sin. As I

out of God's Word (Ps. 119:18). In answer to prayer I get wisdom to know God's
way (Jas. 1:5) and strength to walk in it. As I meet God in prayer and gaze

Prayer brings power into our work. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>If
we wish power for any work to which God calls us, be it preaching, teaching,
personal work, or the rearing of our children, we can get it by earnest prayer.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>A
woman with a little <span class="GramE">boy</span> who was perfectly
incorrigible, once came to me in desperation and said: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>"What
shall I do with him?" <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>I
asked, "Have you ever tried prayer?" <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>She
said that she had prayed for him, she thought. I asked if she had made his
conversion and his character a matter of definite, expectant prayer. She
replied that she had not been definite in the matter. She began that day, and
at once there was a marked change in the child, and he grew up into Christian
manhood. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>How
many a Sunday-school teacher has taught for months and years, and seen no real
fruit from his <span class="SpellE">labors</span>, and then has learned the
secret of intercession, and by earnest pleading with God, has seen his scholars
brought one by one to Christ! How many a poor preacher has become a mighty man
of God by casting away his confidence in his own ability and gifts, and giving
himself up to God to wait upon Him for the power that comes from on high! John
Livingstone spent a night, with some others likeminded, in prayer to God and
religious conversation, and when he preached next day in the Kirk of <span class="SpellE">Shotts</span> five hundred people were converted, or dated some
definite uplift in their life to that occasion. Prayer and power are
inseparable. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Prayer avails for the conversion of others. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>There
are few converted in this world unless in connection with some one's prayers. I
formerly thought that no human being had anything to do with my own conversion,
for I was not converted in church or Sunday-school, or in personal <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>conversation</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> with any one. I was awakened in the middle
of the night and converted. As far as I can remember I had not the slightest
thought of being converted, or of anything of that character, when I went to
bed and fell asleep; but I was awakened in the middle of the night and
converted probably inside of five minutes. <span class="GramE">A few minutes
before I was about as near eternal perdition as one gets.</span> I had one foot
over the brink and was trying to get the other one over. I say I thought no
human being had anything to do with it, but I had forgotten my mother's
prayers, and I afterward learned that one of my college classmates had chosen
me as one to pray for until I was saved. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Prayer
often avails where everything else fails. How utterly all of Monica's efforts
and entreaties failed with her son, but her prayers prevailed with God, and the
dissolute youth became St. Augustine, the mighty man of God. By prayer the
bitterest enemies of the Gospel have become its most valiant defenders, the
greatest scoundrels the truest sons of God, and the vilest women the purest
saints. Oh, the power of prayer to reach down, down, down, where hope itself
seems vain, and lift men and women up, up, up into fellowship with and likeness
to God. It is simply wonderful! How little we appreciate this <span class="SpellE">marvelous</span> weapon! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>(4) Prayer brings blessings to the church. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>The
history of the church has always been a history of grave difficulties to
overcome. The devil hates the church and seeks in every way to block its
progress; now by false doctrine, again by division, again by inward corruption
of life. But by prayer, a clear way can be made through everything. Prayer will
root out heresy, allay misunderstanding, sweep away jealousies and animosities,
obliterate immoralities, and bring in the full tide of God's reviving grace.
History abundantly proves this. In the hour of darkest portent, when the case
of the church, local or universal, has seemed beyond hope, believing men and
believing women have met together and cried to God and the answer has come. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>It
was so in the days of Knox, it was so in the days of Wesley and Whitfield, it
was so in the days of Edwards and Brainerd, it was so in the days of Finney, it
was so in the days of the great revival of 1857 in this country and of 1859 in
Ireland, and it will be so again in your day and mine. Satan has marshalled his
forces. Christian <span class="GramE">science</span> with its false Christ--a
woman--lifts high its head. Others making great pretensions of apostolic
methods, but covering the rankest dishonesty and hypocrisy with these <span class="GramE">pretensions,</span> speak with loud assurance. Christians equally
loyal to the great fundamental truths of the Gospel are glowering at one
another with a devil-sent suspicion. The world, the flesh and the devil are
holding high carnival. It is now a dark day, BUT--now "it is time for
Thee, Lord, to work; for they have made void Thy law." (Ps. 199:126). And
He is <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the voice of prayer. Will He hear it? Will He hear it from you? Will He hear it
from the church as a body? I believe He will. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

IMPORTANCE OF PRAYER <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>In
the 6th chapter of Ephesians in the 18th verse we read words which put the
tremendous importance of prayer with startling and overwhelming force: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:

<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>When
we stop to weigh the meaning of these words, <span class="GramE">then</span> note
the connection in which they are found, the intelligent child of God is driven
to say, "I must pray, pray, pray. I must put all my energy and all my
heart into prayer. Whatever else I do, I must pray." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>The

<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>"With
all prayer and supplication praying at all seasons in the spirit, and watching

<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Note
the ALLS: "with ALL prayer," "at ALL seasons," "in ALL
perseverance," "for ALL the saints." Note the piling up of
strong words, "prayer," "supplication,"
"perseverance." Note once more the strong expression, "watching
thereunto," more literally, "being sleepless thereunto." Paul
realized the natural slothfulness of man, and especially his natural
slothfulness in prayer. How seldom we pray things through! How often the church
and the individual get right up to the verge of a great blessing in prayer and
just then let go, get drowsy, quit. I wish that these words "being
sleepless unto prayer" might burn into our hearts. I wish the whole verse
might burn into our hearts. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>But
why is this constant, persistent, sleepless, overcoming prayer so needful? <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>1.
First of all, BECAUSE THERE IS A DEVIL. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>He
is cunning, he is mighty, he never rests, he is ever plotting the downfall of
the child of God; and if the child of God relaxes in prayer, the devil will
succeed in ensnaring him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>This
is the thought of the context. The 12th verse reads: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>"For
our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities,
against the powers, against the world rulers of this darkness, against the
spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places." <span class="GramE">(R.V.)</span>
Then comes the 13th verse: "Wherefore take up the <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>whole</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> <span class="SpellE">armor</span> of God,
that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, having done all, to
stand." <span class="GramE">(R.V.)</span> Next follows a description of the
different parts of the Christian's <span class="SpellE">armor</span>, which we
are to put on if we are to stand against the devil and his mighty wiles. Then
Paul brings all to a climax in the 18th verse, telling us that to all else we
must add prayer -- constant, persistent, untiring, sleepless prayer in the Holy
Spirit, or all else will go for nothing. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>2.
A second reason for this constant, persistent, sleepless, overcoming prayer is
that PRAYER IS GOD'S APPOINTED WAY FOR OBTAINING THINGS, AND THE GREAT SECRET OF
ALL LACK IN OUR EXPERIENCE, <span class="GramE">IN</span> OUR LIFE AND IN OUR
WORK IS NEGLECT OF PRAYER. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>James
brings this out very forcibly in the 4th chapter and 2nd verse of his epistle:
"Ye have not because you ask not." These words contain the secret of
the poverty and powerlessness of the average Christian -- neglect of prayer. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>"Why
is it," many a Christian is asking, "I make so little progress in my
Christian life?" <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>"Neglect
of prayer," God answers. "You have not because you ask not." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>"Why
is it," many a minister is asking, "I see so little fruit from my <span class="SpellE">labors</span>?" <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Again
God answers, "Neglect of prayer. You have not because you ask not." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>"Why
is it," many a Sunday-School teacher is asking, "that I see so few
converted in my Sunday-School class?" <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4" style="page-break-before:always"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Still God answers, "Neglect of prayer.
You have not because you ask not." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>"Why
is it," both ministers and churches are asking, "that the church of
Christ makes so little headway against unbelief and error and sin and
worldliness?" <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Once
more we hear God answering, "Neglect of prayer. You have not because you
ask not." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>3.
The third reason for this constant, persistent, sleepless, overcoming prayer is
that THOSE MEN WHOM GOD SET FORTH AS A PATTERN OF WHAT HE EXPECTED CHRISTIANS
TO BE -- THE APOSTLES -- REGARDED PRAYER AS THE MOST IMPORTANT BUSINESS OF
THEIR LIVES. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>When
the multiplying responsibilities of the early church crowded in upon them, they
"called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, <span class="GramE">It</span> is not reason that we should leave the Word of God, and
serve tables. Wherefore, brethren, look you out among <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>you</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> seven men of honest report, full of the
Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business. But WE WILL GIVE
OURSELVES CONTINUALLY TO PRAYER and to the ministry of the Word." It is
evident from what Paul wrote to the churches and to individuals about praying
for them, that very much of his time and strength and thought was given to
prayer. (Rom. 1:9, R.V.; Eph. 1:15<span class="GramE">,16</span>; Col. 1:9, R.V.;
1_Thess. 3:10; 2_Tim. 1:3, R.V.) <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>All
the mighty men of God outside the Bible have been men of prayer. They have
differed from one another in many things, but in this they have been alike. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>4.
But there is a still weightier reason for this constant, persistent, sleepless,
overcoming prayer. It is, PRAYER OCCUPIED A VERY PROMINENT PLACE AND PLAYED A
VERY IMPORTANT PART IN THE EARTHLY LIFE OF OUR LORD. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Turn,
for example, to Mark 1:35. We read, "And in the morning, rising up a great
while before day, He went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there
prayed." The preceding day had been a very busy and exciting one, but
Jesus shortened the <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>hours</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> of needed sleep that He might arise early
and give Himself to more sorely needed prayer. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Turn
again to Luke 6:12, where we read, "And it came to pass in those days that
He went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to
God." Our <span class="SpellE">Savior</span> found it necessary on occasion
to take a whole night for prayer. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>The
words "pray" and "prayer" are used at least twenty-five
times in connection with our Lord in the brief record of His life in the four
Gospels, and His praying is mentioned in places where the words are not used.
Evidently prayer took much of the time and <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>strength</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> of Jesus, and a man or woman who does not
spend much time in prayer, cannot properly be called a follower of Jesus
Christ. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>5.
There is another reason for constant, persistent, sleepless, overcoming prayer
that seems if possible even more <span class="GramE">forcible</span> than this,
namely, PRAYING IS <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4" style="page-break-before:always"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>THE MOST IMPORTANT
PART OF THE PRESENT MINISTRY OF OUR RISEN LORD.</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Christ's
ministry did not close with His death. His atoning work was finished then, but
when He rose and ascended to the right hand of the Father, He entered upon

<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>What
that great present work is, by which He carries our salvation on to
completeness, we read in Heb. 7:25, "Wherefore He is able also to save
them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing HE EVER LIVETH TO MAKE
INTERCESSION FOR THEM." This verse tells us that Jesus is able to save us
unto the uttermost, not merely FROM the uttermost, but UNTO the uttermost, unto
entire <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>, absolute perfection, because He not merely
died, but because He also "ever <span class="SpellE">liveth</span>."
The verse also tells us for what purpose He now lives, "TO MAKE
INTERCESSION FOR US," to pray. Praying is the principal thing He is doing
in these days. It is by His prayers that He is saving us. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>The
same thought is found in Paul's remarkable, triumphant challenge in Rom. 8:34
-- "Who is he that shall condemn? It is Christ Jesus that died, yea
rather, that was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, WHO ALSO
MAKETH INTERCESSION FOR US." <span class="GramE">(R.V.)</span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>If
we then are to have fellowship with Jesus Christ in His present work, we must
spend much time in prayer; we must give ourselves to earnest, constant,
persistent, sleepless, overcoming prayer. I know of nothing that has so
impressed me with a sense of the importance of praying at all seasons, being
much and constantly in prayer, as the thought that that is the principal
occupation at present of my risen Lord. I want to have fellowship with Him, and
to that end I have asked the Father that whatever else He may make me, to make
me at all events an intercessor, to make me a man who knows how to pray, and
who spends much time in prayer. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>This
ministry of intercession is a glorious and a mighty ministry, and we can all have

The sixth reason for constant, persistent, sleepless, overcoming prayer is that
PRAYER IS THE MEANS THAT GOD HAS APPOINTED FOR OUR RECEIVING MERCY, AND
OBTAINING GRACE TO HELP IN TIME OF NEED. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Heb.
4:16 is one of the simplest and sweetest verses in the Bible, -- "Let us
therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4" style="page-break-before:always"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>find</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> grace to help in
time of need." These words make it very plain that God has appointed a way
by which we shall seek and obtain mercy and grace. That way is prayer; bold,
confident, outspoken approach to the throne of grace, the most holy place of
God's presence, where our sympathizing High Priest, Jesus Christ, has entered
in our behalf. <span class="GramE">(Verses 14, 15.)</span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Mercy
is what we need, grace is what we must have, or all our life and effort will
end in complete failure. Prayer is the way to get them. There is infinite grace
at our disposal, and we make it ours experimentally by prayer. Oh, if we only
realized the <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:

font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> of God's grace, that is ours for the
asking, its height and depth and length and breadth, I am sure that we would
spend more time in prayer. The measure of our appropriation of grace is
determined by the measure of our prayers. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Who
is there that does not feel that he needs more grace? Then ask for it. Be
constant and persistent in your asking. Be importunate and untiring in your
asking. God delights to have us "shameless" beggars in this
direction; for it shows our faith in <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Him,
and He is mightily pleased with faith. Because of our "shamelessness"
He will rise and give us as much as we need (Luke 11:8). What little streams of
mercy and grace most of us know, when we might know rivers overflowing their
banks! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

The next reason for constant, persistent, sleepless, overcoming prayer is that
PRAYER IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST IS THE WAY JESUS CHRIST HIMSELF HAS
APPOINTED FOR HIS DISCIPLES TO OBTAIN FULLNESS OF JOY. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>He
states this simply and beautifully in John 16:24, "Hitherto have you asked
nothing in <span class="GramE">My</span> name; ask, and you shall receive, that
your joy may be fulfilled." "Made full" is the way the Revised
Version reads. Who is there that does not wish his joy filled full? Well, the
way to have it filled full is by praying in the name of Jesus. We all know
people whose joy is filled full, indeed, it is just running over, is shining
from their eyes, bubbling out of their very lips, and running off their finger
tips when they shake hands with you. Coming in contact with them is like coming
in contact with an electrical machine charged with gladness. Now people of that
sort are always people that spend much time in prayer. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Why
<span class="GramE">is it</span> that prayer in the name of Christ brings such
fullness of joy? <span class="GramE">In part, because we get what we ask.</span>
But that is not the only reason, nor the greatest. It makes God real. When we
ask something definite of God, and He gives it, how real God <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:

font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>! He is right there! It is blessed to have a
God who is real, and not merely an idea. I remember how once I was taken
suddenly and seriously sick all alone in my study. I dropped upon my knees and
cried to God for help. Instantly all pain left me -- I <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:

font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> perfectly well. It seemed as if God stood
right there, and had put out His hand and touched me. The joy of the healing
was not <span class="GramE">so</span> great as the joy of meeting God. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>There
is no greater joy on earth or in heaven, than communion with God, and prayer in

The eighth reason for constant, persistent, sleepless, overcoming prayer is
that PRAYER, IN EVERY CARE AND ANXIETY AND NEED OF LIFE, WITH THANKSGIVING, IS
THE MEANS THAT GOD HAS APPOINTED FOR OBTAINING FREEDOM FROM ALL ANXIETY, <span class="GramE">AND</span> THE PEACE OF GOD WHICH PASSETH ALL UNDERSTANDING. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>"Be
careful for nothing," says Paul, "but in everything by prayer and
supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God, and
the peace of God which <span class="SpellE">passeth</span> all understanding,
shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ <o:p></o:p></span></p>

(Phil. 4:6<span class="GramE">,7</span>.) To many this seems at the first glance,
the picture of a life that is beautiful, but beyond the reach of ordinary
mortals; not so at all. The verse tells us how the life is attainable by every
child of God: "Be careful for nothing," or as the Revised Version
reads, "In nothing be anxious." The remainder of the verse tells us
how, and it is very simple: "But in everything by prayer and supplication
with thanksgiving let your requests <span class="GramE">be</span> made known unto
God." What could be plainer or <span class="GramE">more simple</span> than
that? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is glorious, and as simple as it is glorious! Thank God, many are trying it.

The ninth reason for constant, persistent, sleepless, overcoming prayer is that

many have received the Holy Spirit the moment of their surrender to God before

no one could speak or pray, but sobs of joy filled the place. Men went out of
that room to different parts of the country, taking trains that very morning,

<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>One
of the most interesting and solemn passages upon prayer in the Bible is along
this line. (Luke 21:34-36) "Take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your
hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness and cares of this life,
and so <span class="GramE">that day come</span> upon you unawares. For as a snare
shall it come on all them that dwell in the face of the whole <span class="GramE">earth.</span> Watch you therefore, and PRAY ALWAYS, that you may be
accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to
stand before the Son of man." According to this passage there is only one
way in which we can be prepared for the coming of the Lord when He appears,
that is, through much prayer. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>The
coming again of Jesus Christ is a subject that is awakening much interest and
much discussion in our day; but it is one thing to be interested in the Lord's
return, and to talk about it, and quite another thing to be prepared for it. We
live in an atmosphere that has a constant tendency to unfit us for Christ's
coming. The world tends to draw us down by its gratifications and by its cares.
There is only one way by which we can rise triumphant above these things--by
constant watching unto prayer, that is, by sleeplessness unto prayer.
"Watch" in this passage is the same strong word used in Eph. 6:18,
and "always" the same strong phrase "in every season." The
man who spends little time in prayer, who is not steadfast and constant in
prayer, will not be ready for the Lord when He comes. But we may be ready. How?

There is one more reason for constant, persistent, sleepless, overcoming
prayer, and it is a mighty one: BECAUSE OF WHAT PRAYER ACCOMPLISHES. Much has
really been said upon that already, but there is much also that should be added.

is through prayer that my sin is brought to light, my most hidden sin. As I

out of God's Word (Ps. 119:18). In answer to prayer I get wisdom to know God's
way (Jas. 1:5) and strength to walk in it. As I meet God in prayer and gaze
into His face, I am changed into His own image from glory to glory (2_Cor.
3:18). Each day of true prayer life finds me liker to my glorious Lord. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

converted probably inside of five minutes. <span class="GramE">A few minutes

often avails where everything else fails. How utterly all of Monica's efforts

bitterest enemies of the Gospel have become its most valiant defenders, the
greatest scoundrels the truest sons of God, and the vilest women the purest
saints. Oh, the power of prayer to reach down, down, down, where hope itself

history of the church has always been a history of grave difficulties to
overcome. The devil hates the church and seeks in every way to block its
progress; now by false doctrine, again by division, again by inward corruption
of life. But by prayer, a clear way can be made through everything. Prayer will
root out heresy, allay misunderstanding, sweep away jealousies and animosities,
obliterate immoralities, and bring in the full tide of God's reviving grace.
History abundantly proves this. In the hour of darkest portent, when the case
of the church, local or universal, has seemed beyond hope, believing men and
believing women have met together and cried to God and the answer has come. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

"perseverance." Note once more the strong expression, "watching

realized the natural slothfulness of man, and especially his natural
slothfulness in prayer. How seldom we pray things through! How often the church
and the individual get right up to the verge of a great blessing in prayer and
just then let go, get drowsy, quit. I wish that these words "being

First of all, BECAUSE THERE IS A DEVIL. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>He
is cunning, he is mighty, he never rests, he is ever plotting the downfall of
the child of God; and if the child of God relaxes in prayer, the devil will
succeed in ensnaring him. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>This
is the thought of the context. The 12th verse reads: <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>"For
our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities,
against the powers, against the world rulers of this darkness, against the
spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places." <span class="GramE">(R.V.)</span>
Then comes the 13th verse: "Wherefore take up the <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:

that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, having done all, to
stand." <span class="GramE">(R.V.)</span> Next follows a description of the
different parts of the Christian's <span class="SpellE">armor</span>, which we
are to put on if we are to stand against the devil and his mighty wiles. Then
Paul brings all to a climax in the 18th verse, telling us that to all else we
must add prayer -- constant, persistent, untiring, sleepless prayer in the Holy
Spirit, or all else will go for nothing. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'><o:p> </o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>2.
A second reason for this constant, persistent, sleepless, overcoming prayer is
that PRAYER IS GOD'S APPOINTED WAY FOR OBTAINING THINGS, AND THE GREAT SECRET OF
ALL LACK IN OUR EXPERIENCE, <span class="GramE">IN</span> OUR LIFE AND IN OUR
WORK IS NEGLECT OF PRAYER. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>James
brings this out very forcibly in the 4th chapter and 2nd verse of his epistle:
"Ye have not because you ask not." These words contain the secret of
the poverty and powerlessness of the average Christian -- neglect of prayer. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>"Why
is it," many a Christian is asking, "I make so little progress in my

The third reason for this constant, persistent, sleepless, overcoming prayer is
that THOSE MEN WHOM GOD SET FORTH AS A PATTERN OF WHAT HE EXPECTED CHRISTIANS
TO BE -- THE APOSTLES -- REGARDED PRAYER AS THE MOST IMPORTANT BUSINESS OF
THEIR LIVES. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>When
the multiplying responsibilities of the early church crowded in upon them, they
"called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, <span class="GramE">It</span> is not reason that we should leave the Word of God, and
serve tables. Wherefore, brethren, look you out among <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>you</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> seven men of honest report, full of the
Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business. But WE WILL GIVE
OURSELVES CONTINUALLY TO PRAYER and to the ministry of the Word." It is
evident from what Paul wrote to the churches and to individuals about praying
for them, that very much of his time and strength and thought was given to
prayer. (Rom. 1:9, R.V.; Eph. 1:15<span class="GramE">,16</span>; Col. 1:9, R.V.;
1_Thess. 3:10; 2_Tim. 1:3, R.V.) <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>All
the mighty men of God outside the Bible have been men of prayer. They have
differed from one another in many things, but in this they have been alike. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'><o:p> </o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>4.
But there is a still weightier reason for this constant, persistent, sleepless,
overcoming prayer. It is, PRAYER OCCUPIED A VERY PROMINENT PLACE AND PLAYED A
VERY IMPORTANT PART IN THE EARTHLY LIFE OF OUR LORD. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Turn,
for example, to Mark 1:35. We read, "And in the morning, rising up a great
while before day, He went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there
prayed." The preceding day had been a very busy and exciting one, but
Jesus shortened the <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>hours</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> of needed sleep that He might arise early
and give Himself to more sorely needed prayer. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Turn
again to Luke 6:12, where we read, "And it came to pass in those days that
He went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to
God." Our <span class="SpellE">Savior</span> found it necessary on occasion
to take a whole night for prayer. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>The
words "pray" and "prayer" are used at least twenty-five
times in connection with our Lord in the brief record of His life in the four
Gospels, and His praying is mentioned in places where the words are not used.

ministry did not close with His death. His atoning work was finished then, but
when He rose and ascended to the right hand of the Father, He entered upon
other work for us just as important in its place as His atoning work. It cannot
be divorced <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>from</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;

basis, but it is necessary to our complete salvation. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>What
that great present work is, by which He carries our salvation on to
completeness, we read in Heb. 7:25, "Wherefore He is able also to save
them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing HE EVER LIVETH TO MAKE
INTERCESSION FOR THEM." This verse tells us that Jesus is able to save us
unto the uttermost, not merely FROM the uttermost, but UNTO the uttermost, unto
entire <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:

font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>, absolute perfection, because He not merely
died, but because He also "ever <span class="SpellE">liveth</span>."
The verse also tells us for what purpose He now lives, "TO MAKE
INTERCESSION FOR US," to pray. Praying is the principal thing He is doing
in these days. It is by His prayers that He is saving us. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>The
same thought is found in Paul's remarkable, triumphant challenge in Rom. 8:34
-- "Who is he that shall condemn? It is Christ Jesus that died, yea
rather, that was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, WHO ALSO
MAKETH INTERCESSION FOR US." <span class="GramE">(R.V.)</span> <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>If
we then are to have fellowship with Jesus Christ in His present work, we must
spend much time in prayer; we must give ourselves to earnest, constant,
persistent, sleepless, overcoming prayer. I know of nothing that has so
impressed me with a sense of the importance of praying at all seasons, being
much and constantly in prayer, as the thought that that is the principal
occupation at present of my risen Lord. I want to have fellowship with Him, and
to that end I have asked the Father that whatever else He may make me, to make
me at all events an intercessor, to make me a man who knows how to pray, and
who spends much time in prayer. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>This
ministry of intercession is a glorious and a mighty ministry, and we can all have
part in it. The man or the woman who is shut away from the public meeting by

for the unsaved, and for foreign missionaries, with the soap and water as she

font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> can have part in it, praying as he hurries
from duty to duty. But of course we must, if we would maintain this spirit of
constant prayer, take time -- and take plenty of it -- when we shall shut
ourselves up in the secret place alone with God for nothing but prayer. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'><o:p> </o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>6.
The sixth reason for constant, persistent, sleepless, overcoming prayer is that
PRAYER IS THE MEANS THAT GOD HAS APPOINTED FOR OUR RECEIVING MERCY, AND
OBTAINING GRACE TO HELP IN TIME OF NEED. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Heb.
4:16 is one of the simplest and sweetest verses in the Bible, -- "Let us
therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4" style="page-break-before:always"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>find</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> grace to help in
time of need." These words make it very plain that God has appointed a way
by which we shall seek and obtain mercy and grace. That way is prayer; bold,
confident, outspoken approach to the throne of grace, the most holy place of
God's presence, where our sympathizing High Priest, Jesus Christ, has entered
in our behalf. <span class="GramE">(Verses 14, 15.)</span> <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Mercy
is what we need, grace is what we must have, or all our life and effort will
end in complete failure. Prayer is the way to get them. There is infinite grace
at our disposal, and we make it ours experimentally by prayer. Oh, if we only
realized the <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>fullness</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> of God's grace, that is ours for the
asking, its height and depth and length and breadth, I am sure that we would
spend more time in prayer. The measure of our appropriation of grace is
determined by the measure of our prayers. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Who
is there that does not feel that he needs more grace? Then ask for it. Be
constant and persistent in your asking. Be importunate and untiring in your
asking. God delights to have us "shameless" beggars in this
direction; for it shows our faith in <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Him,
and He is mightily pleased with faith. Because of our "shamelessness"
He will rise and give us as much as we need (Luke 11:8). What little streams of
mercy and grace most of us know, when we might know rivers overflowing their
banks! <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'><o:p> </o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>7.
The next reason for constant, persistent, sleepless, overcoming prayer is that
PRAYER IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST IS THE WAY JESUS CHRIST HIMSELF HAS
APPOINTED FOR HIS DISCIPLES TO OBTAIN FULLNESS OF JOY. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>He
states this simply and beautifully in John 16:24, "Hitherto have you asked
nothing in <span class="GramE">My</span> name; ask, and you shall receive, that
your joy may be fulfilled." "Made full" is the way the Revised
Version reads. Who is there that does not wish his joy filled full? Well, the
way to have it filled full is by praying in the name of Jesus. We all know
people whose joy is filled full, indeed, it is just running over, is shining
from their eyes, bubbling out of their very lips, and running off their finger
tips when they shake hands with you. Coming in contact with them is like coming
in contact with an electrical machine charged with gladness. Now people of that
sort are always people that spend much time in prayer. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Why
<span class="GramE">is it</span> that prayer in the name of Christ brings such
fullness of joy? <span class="GramE">In part, because we get what we ask.</span>
But that is not the only reason, nor the greatest. It makes God real. When we
ask something definite of God, and He gives it, how real God <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>becomes</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>! He is right there! It is blessed to have a
God who is real, and not merely an idea. I remember how once I was taken
suddenly and seriously sick all alone in my study. I dropped upon my knees and
cried to God for help. Instantly all pain left me -- I <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>was</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> perfectly well. It seemed as if God stood
right there, and had put out His hand and touched me. The joy of the healing
was not <span class="GramE">so</span> great as the joy of meeting God. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>There
is no greater joy on earth or in heaven, than communion with God, and prayer in

Thy presence is fullness of joy." <span class="GramE">(Ps. 16.11.)</span> O

the presence of God! <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Does

The eighth reason for constant, persistent, sleepless, overcoming prayer is
that PRAYER, IN EVERY CARE AND ANXIETY AND NEED OF LIFE, WITH THANKSGIVING, IS
THE MEANS THAT GOD HAS APPOINTED FOR OBTAINING FREEDOM FROM ALL ANXIETY, <span class="GramE">AND</span> THE PEACE OF GOD WHICH PASSETH ALL UNDERSTANDING. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>"Be
careful for nothing," says Paul, "but in everything by prayer and
supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God, and
the peace of God which <span class="SpellE">passeth</span> all understanding,
shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Jesus."
(Phil. 4:6<span class="GramE">,7</span>.) To many this seems at the first glance,
the picture of a life that is beautiful, but beyond the reach of ordinary
mortals; not so at all. The verse tells us how the life is attainable by every
child of God: "Be careful for nothing," or as the Revised Version
reads, "In nothing be anxious." The remainder of the verse tells us
how, and it is very simple: "But in everything by prayer and supplication
with thanksgiving let your requests <span class="GramE">be</span> made known unto
God." What could be plainer or <span class="GramE">more simple</span> than
that? <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Just
keep in constant touch with God, and when any trouble or vexation, great or
small, comes up, speak to Him about it, never forgetting to return thanks for
what He has already done. What will the result be? "The peace of God which

is glorious, and as simple as it is glorious! Thank God, many are trying it.
Don't you know any one who is always serene? Perhaps he is a very stormy man by
his natural make-up, but troubles and conflicts and reverses and bereavements
may sweep <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:

by prayer, that is all. Those persons who know the deep peace of God, the
unfathomable peace that <span class="SpellE">passeth</span> all understanding,
are always men and women of much prayer. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Some
of us let the hurry of our lives crowd prayer out, and what a waste of time and
energy and nerve force there is by the constant worry! One night of prayer will
save us from many nights of insomnia. Time spent in prayer is not wasted, but
time invested at big interest. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'><o:p> </o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>9.

many have received the Holy Spirit the moment of their surrender to God before

since that have been filled with the Holy Spirit in the place of prayer! <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>I
know this as definitely as I know that my thirst has been quenched while I was

the Holy <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Spirit
fell so manifestly, and the whole place was so filled with His presence, that
no one could speak or pray, but sobs of joy filled the place. Men went out of
that room to different parts of the country, taking trains that very morning,
and reports soon came back of the out-pouring of God's Holy Spirit in answer to
prayer. Others went out into the city with the blessing of God upon them. This

of the most interesting and solemn passages upon prayer in the Bible is along
this line. (Luke 21:34-36) "Take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your
hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness and cares of this life,
and so <span class="GramE">that day come</span> upon you unawares. For as a snare
shall it come on all them that dwell in the face of the whole <span class="GramE">earth.</span> Watch you therefore, and PRAY ALWAYS, that you may be
accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to
stand before the Son of man." According to this passage there is only one
way in which we can be prepared for the coming of the Lord when He appears,
that is, through much prayer. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>The
coming again of Jesus Christ is a subject that is awakening much interest and
much discussion in our day; but it is one thing to be interested in the Lord's
return, and to talk about it, and quite another thing to be prepared for it. We
live in an atmosphere that has a constant tendency to unfit us for Christ's
coming. The world tends to draw us down by its gratifications and by its cares.
There is only one way by which we can rise triumphant above these things--by
constant watching unto prayer, that is, by sleeplessness unto prayer.
"Watch" in this passage is the same strong word used in Eph. 6:18,
and "always" the same strong phrase "in every season." The
man who spends little time in prayer, who is not steadfast and constant in
prayer, will not be ready for the Lord when He comes. But we may be ready. How?
Pray! Pray! Pray! <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'><o:p> </o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>11.
There is one more reason for constant, persistent, sleepless, overcoming
prayer, and it is a mighty one: BECAUSE OF WHAT PRAYER ACCOMPLISHES. Much has
really been said upon that already, but there is much also that should be added.

Prayer promotes our spiritual growth as almost nothing else, indeed as nothing
else but Bible study; and true prayer and true Bible study go hand in hand. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>It
is through prayer that my sin is brought to light, my most hidden sin. As I
kneel before God and pray, "Search me, O God, and know my heart; try me,
and know my thoughts; and see if there be any wicked way in me,"
(Ps.139:23<span class="GramE">,24</span>), God shoots the <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>penetrating</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> rays of His light into the innermost
recesses of my heart, and the sins I never suspected are brought to view. In
answer to prayer, God washes me from mine iniquity and cleanses me from my sin
(Ps. 51:2). In answer to prayer my eyes are opened to behold wondrous things
out of God's Word (Ps. 119:18). In answer to prayer I get wisdom to know God's
way (Jas. 1:5) and strength to walk in it. As I meet God in prayer and gaze
into His face, I am changed into His own image from glory to glory (2_Cor.
3:18). Each day of true prayer life finds me liker to my glorious Lord. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>John
Welch, son-in-law to John Knox, was one of the most faithful men of prayer this
world ever saw. He counted that day ill-spent in which seven or eight hours
were not used alone with God in prayer and the study of His Word. An old man

Prayer brings power into our work. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>If
we wish power for any work to which God calls us, be it preaching, teaching,
personal work, or the rearing of our children, we can get it by earnest prayer.
<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>A
woman with a little <span class="GramE">boy</span> who was perfectly
incorrigible, once came to me in desperation and said: <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>"What
shall I do with him?" <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>I
asked, "Have you ever tried prayer?" <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>She
said that she had prayed for him, she thought. I asked if she had made his
conversion and his character a matter of definite, expectant prayer. She
replied that she had not been definite in the matter. She began that day, and
at once there was a marked change in the child, and he grew up into Christian
manhood. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>How
many a Sunday-school teacher has taught for months and years, and seen no real
fruit from his <span class="SpellE">labors</span>, and then has learned the
secret of intercession, and by earnest pleading with God, has seen his scholars
brought one by one to Christ! How many a poor preacher has become a mighty man
of God by casting away his confidence in his own ability and gifts, and giving
himself up to God to wait upon Him for the power that comes from on high! John
Livingstone spent a night, with some others likeminded, in prayer to God and
religious conversation, and when he preached next day in the Kirk of <span class="SpellE">Shotts</span> five hundred people were converted, or dated some
definite uplift in their life to that occasion. Prayer and power are
inseparable. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'><o:p> </o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>(3)
Prayer avails for the conversion of others. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>There
are few converted in this world unless in connection with some one's prayers. I
formerly thought that no human being had anything to do with my own conversion,
for I was not converted in church or Sunday-school, or in personal <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>conversation</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> with any one. I was awakened in the middle
of the night and converted. As far as I can remember I had not the slightest
thought of being converted, or of anything of that character, when I went to
bed and fell asleep; but I was awakened in the middle of the night and
converted probably inside of five minutes. <span class="GramE">A few minutes
before I was about as near eternal perdition as one gets.</span> I had one foot
over the brink and was trying to get the other one over. I say I thought no
human being had anything to do with it, but I had forgotten my mother's
prayers, and I afterward learned that one of my college classmates had chosen
me as one to pray for until I was saved. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Prayer
often avails where everything else fails. How utterly all of Monica's efforts
and entreaties failed with her son, but her prayers prevailed with God, and the
dissolute youth became St. Augustine, the mighty man of God. By prayer the
bitterest enemies of the Gospel have become its most valiant defenders, the
greatest scoundrels the truest sons of God, and the vilest women the purest
saints. Oh, the power of prayer to reach down, down, down, where hope itself
seems vain, and lift men and women up, up, up into fellowship with and likeness
to God. It is simply wonderful! How little we appreciate this <span class="SpellE">marvelous</span> weapon! <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4" style="page-break-before:always"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;

font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>(4) Prayer brings blessings to the church. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>The
history of the church has always been a history of grave difficulties to
overcome. The devil hates the church and seeks in every way to block its
progress; now by false doctrine, again by division, again by inward corruption
of life. But by prayer, a clear way can be made through everything. Prayer will
root out heresy, allay misunderstanding, sweep away jealousies and animosities,
obliterate immoralities, and bring in the full tide of God's reviving grace.
History abundantly proves this. In the hour of darkest portent, when the case
of the church, local or universal, has seemed beyond hope, believing men and
believing women have met together and cried to God and the answer has come. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>It
was so in the days of Knox, it was so in the days of Wesley and Whitfield, it
was so in the days of Edwards and Brainerd, it was so in the days of Finney, it
was so in the days of the great revival of 1857 in this country and of 1859 in
Ireland, and it will be so again in your day and mine. Satan has marshalled his
forces. Christian <span class="GramE">science</span> with its false Christ--a
woman--lifts high its head. Others making great pretensions of apostolic
methods, but covering the rankest dishonesty and hypocrisy with these <span class="GramE">pretensions,</span> speak with loud assurance. Christians equally
loyal to the great fundamental truths of the Gospel are glowering at one
another with a devil-sent suspicion. The world, the flesh and the devil are
holding high carnival. It is now a dark day, BUT--now "it is time for
Thee, Lord, to work; for they have made void Thy law." (Ps. 199:126). And
He is <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>getting</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> ready to work, and now He is listening for
the voice of prayer. Will He hear it? Will He hear it from you? Will He hear it
from the church as a body? I believe He will. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'><o:p> </o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'><o:p> </o:p></span></p><div class="clear"></div><div id="bottombar">
