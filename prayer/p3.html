                            <p><b>Title:</b> The Prayer of Faith</p>
Mark
11:24<span>-26'Therefore I say
unto you, What things soever you desire, when you
pray, believe that you receive <i>them</i>,
and you shall have <i>them</i>.And when you stand praying, forgive, if you have ought against any: that your Father also which is in
heaven may forgive you your trespasses.But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven
forgive your trespasses.'</span></p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The characteristics of the
prayer of faith.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mark 11:24<span> literally says 'All things whatsoever praying you ask'.The English Bible has 'you desire'.Desire can be built upon an emotion and
     led by self rather than the Holy Spirit.The desire to gratify self interests will not be answered.George Muller always sought the glory of
     God and sought to be certain that he was not being motivated by self
     interest.See <a href="muller1.htm">Lesson 1</a> </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There is no place for uncertainty in prayer.Much prayer is offered without knowing
     the mind of the Lord.We must be
     fully assured of the will of God and pray with full assurance of faith
     upon the word of God,'believe<span> that you receive <i>them...'</i></span>Find a specific promise in scripture or a
     general promise.Pray asking the
     promise.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We will not see answered prayer if we grieve the Holy
     Spirit.The prayer of faith must be
     under the control of the Holy Spirit.We have the witness of the Spirit when God's Spirit bears witness
     with our spirit.But there is an
     empowerment of the Holy Spirit that enables the gifts of the Spirit to be
     in operation in our lives.We can
     pray the prayer of faith on a higher level when the Holy Spirit empowers
     us with a Word of Wisdom, a Word of Knowledge, or the Gift of Faith.The manifestations of the Spirit enable
     the body of Christ to pray with great faith and power.</li>
</ul>

Story: </b><span><a href="finney3.html">Praying for the
Holy Spirit</a><a name="_Hlt98424387"></a></span><b></b>Charles Finney.</p>
<h3>Question</h3>
<p>Is it necessary
to pray for the Holy Spirit?</p>
<p>Yes scripture tells us to ask for the Holy
Spirit.Luke 11:13'If<span> you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto
your children: how much more shall <i>your</i>
heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?'</span>We know from the
scriptures that it is His will to give the Holy Spirit.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>We must pray for the Holy Spirit because we can do nothing
     without the help of the Holy Spirit.<b></b></span><span>John 15:5'I am the
     vine, ye <i>are</i> the branches: He that abides in me, and I in him, the
     same brings forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.'</span> We are dependent upon
     Him daily in order to live effective lives that glorify the Lord. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The disciples prayed for the manifestations of the Holy Spirit
     to accompany the preaching of the Word.Acts
     4:29-30.God answered the prayer in Acts 4:30<span>.We need the Holy Spirit to confirm His
     word today if we are going to see people come to Christ.<b></b></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="GramE"><b>Example of effective prayer.</b></span>Praying for the Baptism
with the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The requirements for answered prayer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Obedience to the word of God - Acts 5:32,'And<span> we are his witnesses of these things; and <i>so is</i> also the Holy Ghost, whom God
     has given to them that obey him.'</span>If the body of Christ is not moving in the power of the Holy
     Spirit it is because the Church is not being obedient to the word of God.We can be deceived into
     not obeying the scripture through the teachings of men.Many of God's people have been deceived into not
     praying for the gift of the Holy Spirit because of wrong teaching.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Standing firm on the promises of God - <span>Acts 1:4 'And, being assembled together with <i>them</i>, commanded them that they
     should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which,
     you have heard of me.'</span>The gift of the Holy Spirit
     is called the promise of the Father.The disciples obeyed the
     command of the Lord and prayed together for the fulfilment of the
     promise.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Being fully persuaded that the promise is given to us - Acts<span> 2:39'For
     the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar
     off, <i>even</i> as many as the Lord
     our God shall call.'</span>Scripture clearly affirms that the promise
     of the Father is given to 'as
     many as be afar off', that includes us today.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Pray, asking with full confidence in faith because
     God will always do what He has promised.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Main
Points:</b></p>
<p>1.We must pray right.</p>
<p>(a)Without wavering-Much prayer is half hearted.Prayer without wavering is not presumptuous prayer.It is prayer that meets God's conditions, and
stands on God's word.Steadfast Faith
will stand firm knowing that God will answer prayer that is firmly founded on
the promises of God.The prayer of faith
does not doubt but asks with full assurance of answered prayer. 'But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth, is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind
and tossed' (James 1:5, 6).</p>
<p>(b)With a renewed mind (not in
carnality).</p>
<p>•We must pray with right
desires.If we are seeking to fulfil
lustful or selfish desires our prayers will not be answered.<span>James 4:3'You ask, and receive not, because ye
ask amiss, that you may consume <i>it</i> upon your lusts.'</span>Right praying always has the
glory of God as the primary concern.</p>
<p>•The prayer of faith asks
according to the will of God. 1 John 5:14'And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we
ask any thing according to his will, he hears us:'We must know His Word.If we are renewed in mind we will know His
will, (Romans 12:1-2).If we obey His word we will
know the truth, (John
8:31-32).The word of God must be in us, Colossians 3:16. </p>
<p>2.We must believe right.</p>
<p>(a)God will keep His
promises.The prayer of faith is not 'faith in our
faith', it is faith that God keeps His word.The
prayer of faith must stand sure that God will fulfil His Word.The assurance of prayer is in the promises of
God.<span>2 Corinthians 1:20'For all the promises of God in him <i>are</i> yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us.'</span>Faith holds firm that
God will do what He has promised. Psalm 119:49'Remember the word unto thy servant,
upon which thou hast caused me to hope'.</p>
<p>(b)God will fulfil His purposes.The prayer of faith must have assurance that
the purposes of God for our lives will be fulfilled.Romans 8:28'And<span> we
know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who
are the called according to <i>his</i> purpose.' </span>We can pray with certainty knowing that the
will of God for our lives will be fulfilled.<span>1Thessalonians 5:24'Faithful <i>is</i> he that calls you,
who also will do <i>it</i>.'</span></p>
<p>3.We must be careful to keep in right relationships with one
another.</p>
<p>(a)With a forgiving heart.The prayer of faith must be united to a
forgiving heart.Unforgiveness
will prevent answered prayer.Jesus
said in connection with prayer that our sins will not be forgiven unless we
forgive, Mt 6:15But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your
Father forgive your trespasses.Jesus
forgave those who crucified Him, Luke 23:34Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them;
for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast
lots.How much more
should we forgive those who wrong us.Stephen even forgave the Religious leaders who
murdered him.Acts 7:60'And he kneeled
down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And
when he had said this, he fell asleep.'The
great answer to Stephen's prayer was the ministry of the Apostle Paul. </p>
<p>(b)With the fruit of the Spirit.</p>
<p>•Love.The
prayer of faith must always be united with the fruit of love. Ephesians 5:2'And walk in love, as Christ also hath
loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for
a sweetsmelling savour.'We must be sensitive to the
Holy Spirit in our lives.Being tender
hearted towards one another and not holding grudges or bitterness in our
hearts.Ephesians 4:30-32.Our heart will condemn us when we pray if we
do not walk in love, 1 John 3:20 'For if our heart condemn
us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.'Christians who have an effective prayer life
have learnt to walk in love, 1 Corinthians 13.</p>
<p>•Gentleness.We
must be gentle in our dealings with one another.<span>1Timothy 2:24-26'And the servant
of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all <i>men</i>, apt to teach,
patient,In meekness instructing those
that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the
acknowledging of the truth;And <i>that</i>
they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken
captive by him at his will.'</span>Christian leaders must be careful to be gentle towards all and always
willing to forgive.Harsh words can hit
people so hard that they never recover.We should always seek to build one another up. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is painful to remember the times when we have acted or spoken harshly and in
a wrong manner.I have learnt by painful
experience that winning an argument is not worth the feeling of sadness
associated with knowing we have hurt others.Take my advice if there is contention in the Church walk away.Church leaders should seek to avoid contention
in the Church. 1 Corinthians 11:16 'But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom,
neither the churches of God.'</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The characteristics of the prayer of faith
are </p>
<ol>
<li>Right praying that is built upon the word and will of God and
     seeks only the glory of God.</li>
<li>Right beliefs that are built upon the promises of God, the plan
     and purpose of God and under the control of the Holy Spirit. </li>
<li>Right relationships with one another so that the Holy Spirit is
     not grieved. Unforgiveness will hinder answered
     prayer.</li>
