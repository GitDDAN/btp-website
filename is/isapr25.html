<h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Skopun and Sandur</h3>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Rain and snow fell during the night, and this morning there was a winter-like cover on the hills, from whence the air was chill.Started at 9.45 for Sandoe(Sandoy). Soon after passing the southern point of Stromoe(Streymoy), a sudden squall came on, the wind and waves rising simultaneously with almost inconceivable rapidity.In two hours we landed at Skaapen(Skopun), and drew up to the largest house in this little hamlet. Some sweet milk andruskswere promptly set before us, after which we set off on foot for Sandoe(Sandur), about seven miles distant. We called at the house of theSysselman, who was not in, so we next went forward to see the resident minister, who journeyed with us fromGrangemouthtoFaroelast year. He received us kindly, and expressed himself ready to promote our having a meeting, and went with us back to theSysselmans, at whose house it was agreed the people should be called together, and notice was promptly sent out accordingly.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The minister suggested that the people would like the meeting to commence with apsalm,it was what they were accustomed to. TheSysselmanhas a very good knowledge of English, and to him I explained that it was our custom to assemble in silence - that we brought nothing prepared beforehand, but trusted if it were right to speak, it would be given us what to say; with this he appeared satisfied, and the pastor said no more. About forty assembled, and the meeting held for an hour-and-a-half, commencing and ending agreeably, the people showing marked attention. The pastor, a man of great fluency of speech, acknowledged on the rising of the meeting, in his own name and that of the congregation, the visit of the two strangers who had come from far, and the goodness of the Lord in putting into their hearts by His Spirit to come among them for the good of souls.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">A simple but ample repast was spread for us by the wife of our kind host, and a few words were spoken in love to those who sat round, before rising from the table. The parting words of theSysselman, spoken in good English, and with evident feeling, were touchingly interesting, "God bless you for what you are doing in His name." It was near half-past seven when we left to retrace the morning's track of mountain and moor. The family had retired to rest before we arrived, but quickly rose and gave us a kind welcome.</p>
