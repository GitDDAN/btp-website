Hold on to
'kalos'.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Kalos - translated 'good'</p>
<p>Kalos refers to something that is naturally
good.Consequently it is beautiful,
perfect, good, either physically or morally.All its inherent attributes are in complete harmony. Luke 8:15 'An honest heart' (kalos)</p>
<p>Kalos refers to something that is beautiful
in itself.It is to be admired for its
own beauty.</p>
<p>Kalos the beauty is seen.'Let your light shine that men may see your good (kalos)
works'.</p>
<p>The beauty of the works are seen.</p>
<p><b>Introductory
illustration: </b>Appearances matter.</p>
<p>What we do is very important but the
appearance of what we do is also important. </p>
<p>We often say 'I don't care what people
think'.But what people think of the
assembly together and Christians individually is very important. </p>
<p>The Bible says 'getaway from all appearance
of evil'.</p>
<p>It isn't enough not to do evil, we must
separate ourselves from all appearance of evil.</p>
<p><b>Illustration: </b></p>
<p><span>Rembrandt was a great 17<sup>th</sup>
century Dutch painter.</span></p>
<p>Until modern methods were discovered to
clean Rembrandts paintings it was thought they were dull and gloomy.</p>
<p><span>This fitted with the image that is associated with the 17<sup>th</sup> century </span> Dutch people, stern (enforcing strict
discipline), Calvinistic, and hard working people.</p>
<p>But now the beautiful colours of Rembrandts
paintings are seen in art galleries around the world.So I can never really know Rembrandt until I
go to an Art gallery like the National Gallery in London and look at
one of his paintings.It is the
painting that reveals the skill, brilliance and beauty of the artist. </p>
<p>The Bible says we are created in Christ
Jesus for good works - that's agathos</p>
<p>But it also says that we are to let our
light shine so that people will see our good works - that's kalos</p>
<p>And glorify our father which is in heaven.</p>
<p>Sometimes our works can be seen in the
wrong light but we need to make sure that when they are examined properly there
inherent beauty is revealed.</p>
<h2>Exposition</h2>
<h3>1. Contrast between
kalos 'good' and sapros 'bad'.</h3></p>
<p>Matthew 12:33'Either make the tree good (kalos), and his fruit good (kalos);
or else make the tree corrupt (sapros), and his fruit corrupt
(sapros): for the tree is known by his fruit.'</p>
<p>A precious jewel is displayed in a case
with a dark background.The contrast
will bring out the beauty of the jewel.</p>
<p>Kalos is a word that is well described
through contrast because it describes something that is precious because of its
own quality and beauty. </p>
<p>The value, the beauty, and the quality of
kalos is beautiful displayed by the contrast with the dark background of
sapros'</p>
<p>Sapros describes something that is corrupt,
rotten, poor quality, putrid, unfit for use.</p>
<p>Matthew 13:47-48'Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was
cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered
the good (kalos) into vessels, but cast the bad (sapros)
away.'</p>
<p>Good 'kalos' fish contrasted with the
corrupt 'sapros' fish.</p>
<p>Matthew 3:10'And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees:
therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast
into the fire.'</p>
<h3>2. A good (kalos) minister of Jesus Christ will declare
good (kalos) teaching. </h3></p>
<p>1 Timothy 4:6'If you put the brethren in remembrance of these things, you
shall be a good (kalos) minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up
in the words of faith and of good (kalos) doctrine, whereunto you have
attained.'</p>
<p>A good minister - Good doctrine.</p>
<p>Titus
2:7-8'In all things shewing thyself a pattern
of good (kalos) works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,
Sound speech, that cannot be condemned;'</p>
<ul>
<li>The word of the Lord is good and brings great reward.</li>
</ul>
<p>Psalm
19:7-11 'The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of
the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment
of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the
LORD are true and righteous altogether.More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter
also than honey and the honeycomb.Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is
great reward.'</p>
<ul>
<li>The beauty of a good 'kalos' heart is that the law of the Lord
     is written upon it.Hebrews 8:10 '...laws in their minds and
     written on their hearts' The word of the Lord
     should be the meditation of our heart.Psalm
     19:14'Let the words of my mouth,
     and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my
     strength, and my redeemer.'</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Comparison between 'agathos' and 'kalos'.</h3></p>
<p>Romans
8:28'All things work together for good
(agathos) to them that love God and are called according to His purpose'.</p>
<p>The beauty of a good 'agathos' heart is shown by goodness 'the Fruit of the Spirit' flowing out from the heart for the benefit of others.</p>
<p>The beauty of a good 'kalos' heart is that the law of the Lord is written upon it.Hebrews 8:10 '...laws in their minds and written on
their hearts'</p>
<p>'Agathos' is precious because of the benefits it produces. Ephesians 2:10'For we are his workmanship, created in
Christ Jesus unto good (agathos) works, which God hath before ordained that we
should walk in them.'</p>
<p>'Kalos' is precious because of its own beauty. The works themselves are admired.Matthew 5:16 'Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good (kalos) works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.'</p>
<p>Follow after 'agathos' - then look over your shoulder - agathos is following after you and everything is working together for your head.</p>
<p>Hold fast on to Kalos - then look around - He who is precious is holding on to you.Let the beauty of Jesus be seen in me.We are being changed into His likeness.A people zealous for good (kalos) works.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We must hold on to that which is
good (kalos)</p>
<h3>1. The beauty of kalos is seen most clearly in contrast to the evil of the
world.</h3></p>
<h3>2. A good minister will declare good teaching.The word of the Lord is precious to those who
love God.</h3></p>
<h3>3. Goodness flows out of a good heart upon which the law of the Lord is
written.</h3></p>
