                            <p><b>Title:</b>The Importance of Prayer </p>
1 Timothy 2:1-4,'I exhort therefore, that, first of all,
supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all
men;For kings, and for all that are in
authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and
honesty.For this is good and acceptable
in the sight of God our Saviour; Who will have all men to be saved, and to come
unto the knowledge of the truth.'</p>
<p><b>Introduction:</b><span> <b></b>Prayer
is the means God has provided for the church to live victoriously.<b></b></span></p>
<p>•Prayer is
essential to the Christian life because of our dependency upon the Lord.Our methods and activities will be useless
without prayer.Jesus said ' I am the vine, you are the
branches: He that abides in me, and I in him, the same brings forth much fruit:
for without me you can do nothing', John 15:5. Much
money and time is spent in activities but without prayer they will accomplish
little.</p>
<p>•The importance of prayer means it is important to be diligent in all forms
of prayer (1 Timothy 2:1)'supplications, prayers,
intercessions, giving of thanks...'(see Prayer course 2).We should
be seeking to be skilful in prayer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Prayer is important so that the body of
     Christ will have the freedom to live for Christ and evangelise others (1
     Timothy 2:2-4).The devil seeks to close doors for the
     body of Christ to evangelise.It is
     prayer that will open these doors.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Introductory
illustration: </b></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Progress
     is dependent upon communication.<b></b>The ability to communicate is
     essential to progress.Modern
     technology has made communication easy between people anywhere in the
     world.A successful company must
     have board meetings because talking together is essential in building up a
     company.An ambassador for one
     country must be in communication with the people he or she
     represents.Lack of communication
     can lead to an ambassador speaking on his own initiative instead of on
     behalf of the leaders of the nation.This will cause problems for the ambassador and embarrassment to
     the nation he or she represents.With God it is the same.We
     must be in communication with God.Lack of communication can cause us to be led by our own initiative
     instead of the moving of the Holy Spirit.This will cause us many problems.Ideas may be good but only through a prayerful life can we know the
     leading of the Holy Spirit.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><u>Finney on
     Revivals (Lecture IV)</u><b></b>God moves when the Church
     prays.John Knox was a man famous for his
     power in prayer, so that Queen Mary of England (known as Bloody Mary) used to say that she feared his
     prayers more than all the armies of Europe.And events showed that she had reason to
     do it. He used to be in such an agony for the deliverance of his country,
     that he could not sleep. He had a place in his garden where he used to go
     to pray.One night he and several
     friends were praying together, and as they prayed, Knox spoke and said
     that deliverance had come.He could
     not tell what had happened, but he felt that something had taken place,
     for God had heard their prayers. What was it? Why, the next news they had
     was, that Mary was dead!'</li>
</ul>
<h2>Main Points</h2>
<p>The importance of prayer is shown
in scripture because of...</p>
<h3>1. The great value of the blood.</h3>The price that was paid for us to be able to
pray was great.This privilege was
bought for us by the death of the Son of God on the cross.We value things by their cost or by what the
item means to us personally.Prayer should
be highly valued by every believer because it was bought for us at great cost.  A private audience with a king is something most people can only dream about but pray brings us into intimate relationship with the Lord.</p>
<ul>
<li>We are told
     to approach God with boldness. Hebrews 4:14-16,'Seeing then that we have a great high
     priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold
     fast our profession.For we have
     not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities;
     but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.Let us therefore come boldly unto the
     throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time
     of need.'</li>
</ul>
<p>The blood opens up the way for us to draw near to
God.Hebrews 10:19'Having therefore, brethren, boldness to
enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,By a new and living way, which he has consecrated for us, through the
veil, that is to say, his flesh;And
having an high priest over the house of God;Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having
our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure
water.'</p>
<p>Unbelief will stop us from approaching God with
boldness.It is the power of the blood
that gives us access.Denying the power
of the blood is not humility it is unbelief. </p>
<ul>
<li>We have great confidence that the Father
     will give us all things because He was willing to give His Son for us (John 3:16).<b></b></li>
</ul>
<p>There is
nothing more costly than what He has already provided for us.Romans 8:32'He that
spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with
him also freely give us all things?'<b></b></p>
<p>Answered
prayer is our inheritance in Christ through the blood.We are joint heirs with Christ,(Romans 8:17<span>)'And if children, then heirs; heirs of God,
and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with <i>him</i>, that we
may be also glorified together.'</span>All
things are ours in Christ(1
Corinthians 3:22<span>-23)'Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the
world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are
yours;And you are Christ's; and Christ <i>is</i>
God's.</span></p>
<h3>1. The great provision that is ours
through prayer.</h3>1
John 5:14 'if we ask any thing according to his will, he hears us'.</p>
<ul>
<li>We are told that the Father is willing to
     give whatever we desire in the name of Jesus.John 15:16,'You have not chosen me,
     but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that you should go and bring
     forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever you shall
     ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.'</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Prayer will keep us from anxiety and
     worry.God expects us to make our
     requests known to Him. Philippians
     4:6-7,'Be careful for nothing; but
     in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your
     requests be made known unto God.And the peace of God, which passes all understanding, shall keep
     your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.'</li>
</ul>
<p><span>. <b></b></span></p>
<ul>
<li>We will not receive unless we use the
     provision of prayer.James 4:2,'You lust, and have not: you kill, and desire to have, and cannot
     obtain: you fight and war, yet you have not, because you ask not.' God expects us to ask in prayer.We will not see the provision of God in
     our lives unless we are willing to obey God and be diligent in prayer.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Prayer enables us to be continuously in fellowship with God,1 Thessalonians 5:17,'Pray
     without ceasing.'<b></b></li>
</ul>
<p>2.<span><span>The great spiritual warfare.Every person in the body of Christ should be actively involved in
standing against the powers of darkness.Prayer is essential for the church to overcome the enemy,<b> </b></span></span>Ephesians 6:18<b>.</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Without prayer
     it is not possible to war a good warfare, 1 Timothy 1:18.Many believers are not even aware there is a
     spiritual warfare.They do not have
     a heart for the fight.Believers
     who are aware of the great spiritual warfare will be diligent in prayer.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>A good soldier
     in Christ will be watchful in prayer.In Eph 6:18 watching means 'to be sleepless,Greek <i>'agrupneo'</i> from two words <i>'agreuo'</i>
     to chase and <i>'hupnos'</i>, sleep.Watchfulness by keeping oneself
     awake.Note the all's - 'always',
     'with all prayer', 'all perseverance', 'for all saints'.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Prayer is
     necessary to be 'strong in the
     Lord and in the power of His might', Ephesians 6:10.Philippians 4:13. 'I can only do all things through Christ who
     strengthens me.''His strength is
     made perfect in our weakness, 2 Cor.12: 9. Our dependency upon the Lord makes us
     strong, Proverbs 18:10.Jeremiah 9:23-24 'Thus says the LORD, Let not
     the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his
     might, let not the rich man glory in his riches:But let him that glories glory in this,
     that he understands and knows me, that I am the LORD which exercise
     lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these
     things I delight, says the LORD.'</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Prayer is given great priority in the ministry of Jesus and of the
Apostles.</h3></p>
<ul>
<li>Jesus spent much time in prayer, Luke 6:12'And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a
     mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.' <b></b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The
     Apostles gave themselves to the Word of God and prayer.Acts 6:4 'But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to
     the ministry of the word.'<b></b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Jesus taught His disciples to pray and
     told them to be diligent in it.Matthew 6:5-8 'And when you pray, you shall not
     be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues
     and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I
     say unto you, They have their reward.But you, when you pray, enter into your closet, and when you have
     shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which
     sees in secret shall reward you openly. But when you pray, use not vain
     repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for
     their much speaking.Be not you
     therefore like unto them: for your Father knows what things you have need
     of, before you ask him.' <b></b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Prayer is seen to be an essential part
     of the life of the Church in the Acts of the Apostles.Acts 13:3,'And when they had
     fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them
     away.'Acts 14:23,'And
     when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with
     fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.'Acts 16:25,'And
     at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto
     God: and the prisoners heard them.'Acts 20:36,'And when he had thus
     spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all.'Acts 21:5,'And when we had accomplished those
     days, we departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way,
     with wives and children, till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down
     on the shore, and prayed.'<b></b></li>
</ul>
<p>If it was necessary for Jesus to pray then how much more necessary is
it for us to be committed to prayer.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>We know
that prayer is important because:</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> This privilege was bought at great cost and we must recognise the great
value of prayer</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> Prayer is the means God has provided for us to ask and we must
recognise that God will meet our needs in answer to prayer.</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> Prayer is necessary in spiritual warfare and we must recognise the need
for prayer to defeat the enemy.</p>
<p><strong>4)</strong> Prayer is given great importance in the ministry of Jesus and of the
Apostles and we must recognise that we will not be able to accomplish anything
without prayer.</p>
