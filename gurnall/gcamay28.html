<p><b><i>William Gurnall: The Christian in Complete Armour</i></b></p>
<br/>
<h4><span class="text-primary">May 28</span></h4>
<br/>
<p class="Default"><span class="GramE"><b><span>The Inward
Principle of Prayer.</span></b></span><b></b></p>
<p class="Default"><span class="GramE"><span>'In the
Spirit.'</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>BRANCH SECOND. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>[He that would pray in his
own <span class="GramE">spirit,</span> </span></b><b><span>MUST PRAY IN THE SPIRIT OF GOD.] <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<br/>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Having despatched the first importance of this phrase, 'praying in
the spirit,' viz. the spirit of the person that prays, and shown that then
a person prays in the spirit when his own soul and spirit acts in the
duty-when he prays with understanding, fervency, and sincerity; now we
proceed to the second importance of the phrase. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<br/>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>To pray 'in the Spirit'
is to pray in, or with, the Spirit of God; 'praying in the Holy Ghost,' Jude
20.</span></b></p>
<br/>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>So that the note or doctrine to be insisted on will be this, <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<br/>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="GramE"><b><span>DOCTRINE.</span></b></span><span> That to right praying, it is necessary that we pray in, or by, the
Spirit of God. Prayer is the creature's act, but the Spirit's gift. There
is a concurrence both of the Spirit of God and the soul or spirit of the
Christian to the performance of it. Hence we find both the Holy Spirit is said
to pray in us, Romans 8:<span class="GramE">26,</span> and we said to pray in
him, Jude 20. By the first is meant his inspiration, whereby he excites and
assists the creature to and in the work; by the latter the concurrence of the
saint's faculties. The Spirit does not so pray in him as that the Christian does
not exercise his own faculties in the duty, as the <span class="SpellE">*Familists</span>
</span><span lang="EN-US">fondly conceive.In handling this point I shall <span class="SpellE">endeavour</span> to do
these three things: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="GramE"><span lang="EN-US">First</span><span lang="EN-US">.</span></span><span lang="EN-US"> I shall assert the point, and prove the truth of it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Second</span><span lang="EN-US">. Explicate what it is to pray by the Spirit of God.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="GramE"><span lang="EN-US">Third</span><span lang="EN-US">.</span></span><span lang="EN-US"> Make some application of the point.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<br/>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="SpellE"><i><span>*Familist</span></i></span><span>: </span><span>- member of Family <span class="GramE">Of</span>
Love, religious sect of Dutch origin, followers of <span class="SpellE">Hendrik</span>
<span class="SpellE">Niclaes</span>, a 16th-century Dutch merchant. <span class="SpellE">Niclaes</span>' main activity was in <span class="SpellE">Emden</span>,
East <span class="SpellE">Friesland</span> (1540-60). In his <span class="SpellE">Evangelium</span>
<span class="SpellE">regni</span>, issued in England as 'A Joyful Message
of the Kingdom', he invited all "lovers of truth, of what nation and
religion <span class="SpellE">soever</span> they be, Christian, Jews, <span class="SpellE">Mahomites</span>, or Turks, and heathen," to join in a great
fellowship of peace, the Family of Love, giving up all contention over dogma
and seeking to be incorporated into the body of Christ. (Britannica)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<br/>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="GramE"><b><span>FIRST.</span></b></span><span> I shall assert the truth of the point, that to right praying it is
necessary we pray by the Spirit of God. This is clear from Ephesians 2:18,
'Through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.' Mark those
words, 'by one Spirit.' As there is but one Mediator to appear and pray for us
in heaven, so but one Spirit that can pray in us, and we by it, on earth. We
may as well venture to come to the Father through another Mediator than his
Son, as pray by another Spirit than by the Holy Ghost. Therefore our Saviour,
when he would show his dislike of the disciples rash motion, he does it by
telling them, 'You know not what manner of spirit you are of,' Luke 9:55. As if
he had said, <span class="GramE">It</span> behoves you to be well acquainted with
the spirit that acts you in prayer; if your prayers be not breathed in and out
by my Holy Spirit, they are abominable to me and my Father also. The name of
Christ is not more necessary than the Spirit of Christ is in prayer. Christ's
name fits only the Spirit's mouth; it is too great a word for any to speak as
he ought, that has not the Spirit to help him. 'No man can say that Jesus is
the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost,' I Corinthians 12:3. One may say the words
without any special work of the Spirit in him, and so may a parrot; but, to say
Christ is Lord believingly, with thoughts and affections comporting with the
greatness and sweetness thereof, requires the Spirit of God to be in his heart
and tongue. Now it is not the bare naming of Christ in prayer, and saying, 'For
the Lord's sake,' that procures our welcome with God; but saying it in <span class="GramE">faith,</span> and none can do this without the Spirit. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<br/>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Christ is the door that opens into God's presence, and lets the soul
into his very bosom; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="GramE"><span>faith</span></span><span> is the key that unlocks
the door; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="GramE"><span>but</span></span><span> the Spirit is he that both
makes this key, and helps the Christian to turn it in prayer, <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="GramE"><span>so</span></span><span> as to get any access to
God. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>You know in the law it was a sin, not only to offer 'strange incense,'
but also to bring 'strange fire,' Leviticus 10:1. By the incense, which was a
composition of sweet spices appointed by God to be burned as a sweet perfume in
his nostrils, was signified the merit and satisfaction of Christ, who being
bruised by his Father's wrath, did offer up himself a sacrifice to God for a
sweet-smelling savour. By the fire that was put to the incense-which also was
appointed to be taken from the altar, and not any common hearth-was signified
the Spirit of God, by which we are to offer up all our prayers and praises,
even as Christ offered himself up by the eternal Spirit. To plead Christ's
merits in prayer and not by the Spirit, is to bring right incense but strange
fire, and so our prayers are but smoke, offensive to his pure eyes, not
incense, a sweet savour to his nostrils. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>SECOND.</span></b><span> I proceed to explicate what it is to pray by the Spirit of God.
To the better opening of this, we must know that there are two ways that the
Spirit of God helps persons in prayer; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="GramE"><span>one</span></span><span> way is by his gifts, <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="GramE"><span>the</span></span><span> other by his grace. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>1)<span class="GramE">.<i>.</i></span> The Spirit of God helps in prayer <i>by
his gifts</i>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Now those gifts which he furnishes a person with for prayer are either
extraordinary or ordinary. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The extraordinary gifts of the Spirit in prayer were, in the primitive
times, shed forth, whereby the apostles and others were able in a miraculous
manner to pray as well as preach on a sudden in a language that they never had
learned. Of this gift interpreters understand that passage of Paul, 'I will
pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also,' I Corinthians
14:15. That is, he would make use of this extraordinary gift Christ had
furnished him with, but so as he might edify the church by it, and no
otherwise. This extraordinary gift was fitted for the infancy of the gospel
church, and ceased-as others of the like nature did-with it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span>Note: <span class="SpellE">Gurnall</span>
does not give any scripture to uphold his claim that the gifts of the Spirit
ceased during the infancy of the church. If he had given a scripture we would
expect it to be 1 Corinthians 13:10-11 but <span class="SpellE">Gurnall</span> probably
does not use this scripture because the context does not agree with this
interpretation. All the gifts of the Spirit apart from two (tongues and
interpretation) are seen operating at times in the Old Testament - why should
they cease now? Tongues could not happen in the Old Testament because it is the
Spirit moving upon the new heart created in Christ Jesus; <span class="GramE">tongues
required a new heart and is</span> therefore exclusive to the New Testament. Both
scripture and sound reason affirm that the supernatural gifts have not ceased.
Supernatural gifts have continued working and still continue to work in the
church. <span class="SpellE">Gurnall</span> associates tongues with known
languages. This is evident in Acts 2 but Paul says he spoke in tongues more
than everyone in 1 Corinthians 14:18. This would suggest that tongues were a
very important part of Paul's prayer life. (Bible Teaching Program)<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The ordinary gift of the Spirit in prayer is that special faculty
whereby persons are enabled on a sudden to form the conceptions of their minds
and desires of their hearts into apt words before the Lord in prayer. This is a
common gift, and is bestowed on those that are none of the best men. The
hypocrite may have more of this gift than some sincere Christian. It is a gift
that commonly bears proportion to natural endowments, a ready apprehension,
fruitful fancy, voluble tongue, and audacity of spirit, which are all gifts of
the Spirit, and do dispose a person for this. Now we see that the head may be
ripe and the heart rotten; and, on the contrary, the heart sound and sincere
where the head is low-parted. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span>2)<span class="GramE">. <span>The</span></span></span></i><span> Spirit helps in prayer <i>by his grace</i>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>His gifts help to the outward expression, but his grace to the inward
affection. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>By the gifts of the Spirit a person is enabled to take the ear and
affect the heart of men that hear him; but by the grace of the Spirit acting a
soul in prayer, he is enabled to move his own heart and the heart of God also;
and this is the man that indeed prays 'in the Spirit.' The other hath the <i>gift</i>,
but this has the <i>spirit</i>, of prayer. Now, there is a twofold grace
necessary to pray thus in the Spirit. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>1. Grace from the Spirit to sanctify the person that prays. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>2. Grace to act and assist this person sanctified in prayer. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>By the first, the Spirit dwells in the soul; by the second, he acts the
soul. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst"><span><span>1.</span></span><span>There is necessary to this praying in the Spirit, <i>grace to sanctify
the person that prays</i>. Before the creature is renewed and sanctified by the
Holy Ghost, it can neither apprehend nor desire things aright. 'The carnal mind
receives not the things of God, no, 'it is enmity to God.' And is how such a
one fit to pray in an acceptable manner? First, then, the Spirit renews the
creature by infusing those supernatural qualities, or habits of saving
sanctifying graces, which makes him a new creature; by these he comes to dwell
and live in him, and then he acts his own graces thus infused. The soul is in
the body before it acts and moves it. We read of living in the Spirit and
walking in the Spirit, Galatians 5:25: 'If we live in the Spirit, let us also
walk in the Spirit.' Walking supposes life. To pray, hear, or perform any other
holy action in a holy manner, is to walk in the Spirit; but we must live in the
Spirit, or the Spirit live in us -which is all one-before we can thus walk in
the Spirit. There are some acts indeed the Spirit of God puts forth upon souls
that are not thus sanctified -acts of common illumination, restraining grace,
and assisting also. Thus many hypocrites are enabled to pray in excellent
expressions. But he never did assist hypocrite, or any unsanctified person, to
perform the inward part of prayer, to mourn sincerely for sin, to pant after
Christ and his grace, or to cry, 'Abba Father,' believingly; these are the
vital acts of the new creature, and flow from a Spirit of grace infused into
the soul, which follows this 'spirit of supplication,' Zechariah 12:10. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"><span><span>2.</span></span><span>As habitual grace is required to sanctify the person, so <i>actual grace
to assist him as oft as he prays</i>. The Spirit of God may dwell in a soul by
his habitual grace, yet deny actual assistance to this or that particular duty,
and then the poor Christian is becalmed, as a ship at sea when no wind is
stirring. For as grace cannot evidence itself, so neither can it act itself.
Hence it is that sometimes the saint's prayers speed no better, because he is
not acted by the Spirit in it. Samson, when his lock was cut, was 'weak like
another man.' A saint, when the Spirit of God denies his help, prays no better
than a carnal man. The Spirit of God is a free agent: 'Uphold me,' says David,
'with your free spirit,' Psalm 51:12. He is not as a prisoner tied to the oar,
that must <span class="GramE">needs</span> work when we will have him; but, as a
prince, when he pleases he comes forth and shows himself to the soul, and when
he pleases he retires and will not be seen. What freer than the wind? <span class="GramE">not</span> the greatest king on earth can command it to rise for
his pleasure; to this the Spirit of God is compared, John 3:8. He is not only
free to breathe where he lists, in this soul and not that, but when he pleases
also.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
