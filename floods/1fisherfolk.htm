<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Fisherfolk have
always been a unique breed of people. Living constantly in the shadow of a
tragedy, a wife or a mother as she bids farewell to her loved ones leaving for
a fishing trip has the secret fear that she may never see them again. The
fatality rate is very high in comparison with other industries.</span></p>

<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Around the
beginning of the century, the fisher­men usually lived in parts of their towns
near the seafront. Houses were made of granite and often had wooden floors. In
the living room would be the range-fire with a stool extending across the whole
front of the range. Built into one wall would be the "Box-bed", which
was a bed with three sides covered in, hence the name. This arrangement made
the resting place warm and com­fortable. At the rear of the dwelling was the
part which contained the wash-tub and wringer. Nets were often mended in the
garret upstairs or in some cases in an outhouse. In fine days during the
summer, mending would be done outside.</span></p>

<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Some of the
fishermen used lines to catch fish. These lines were baited with mussels which
were gathered from the seashore at a place known as the scaup. This was mainly
the task of the fe­males, while the male members went to sea.Whenever they reached a suitable age, the
females would learn to mend nets, go to the scaup for mussels, to sheel and
bait the lines.</span></p>

<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The staple diet of
fishermen was plain foods, consisting of porridge and soups, with vegetable
broth a speciality. Saturday dinner was salt herring and tattie time. The
herring would be cured in a small barrel at the summer season with another
barrel cured at the East Anglian fishing. Also on their menu would be dried
fish, either ling or tusk. These fish would be cleaned, split down the front,
salted and dried on the rocks.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In some cases
church attendance was regular, each family going to their respective church.
Every household had its own seat in the place of worship and parents would
really feel proud going to church as a whole family. For church the men would
wear dark navy suits, while the women wore dresses down to the calves of their
legs. After the service, especially during the summer, the family would go for
a short walk, but whenever they arrived home their Sunday clothes were exch­anged
for more casual dress. The Sunday clothes were also the attire worn at
funerals, which were occasions of great mourning.When a disaster took place at sea, it would
be a time of deep sorrow, whole communities lamented the loss of an individual
or an entire crew.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Weddings amongst
fisherfolk were times of rejoicing. In the earlier part of this century, a
young fisherman usually chose for his bride a lass from a 'fisher' family,
knowing that she would have a first-hand idea of the hardships he faced.
Another reason being that she would have learned to mend nets, a great asset to
any fisherman who owned gear.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Sea-going men wore
thick underwear, often knitted at home. Their trousers would be made of a
strong material, which gave them the name of "Hairback Troosers". The
home knitted "Faroe Jersies" were
famous and kept them warm in low temperatures. Oilskins which stretched down to
the knees had high necks. On every head was perched the well known
"Sou-wester", which had a small peak at
the front and a longer one at the back. Sea boots to the thighs were
essential.Women when gutting the
herring wore an oil­skin frock known as a "Quite", this reached
almost to the ankles. Rubber boots were supplied by the employer who was a
curer. The head was covered by a scarf. Each of the fingers would have
"Cloots" tied around it for protection from the sharp knives used to
gut. These women work­ed at an astonishing speed.</span></p>

<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A herring drifter
crew consisted of 9 or 10 men including skipper-mate, five deckhands, cook and
two engineers known as the "black squad".Life on deck was very hard. Seventy or eighty
nets had to be pulled in all kinds of weather. It would be very difficult to
get the nets aboard if the wind changed direction after the nets were laid.
When the nets were on board, if the catch was reasonable, the nets had to be
"red up" that is cleaned. This was a task that was performed with
extreme caution, as it was undertaken when the drifter was steaming at top speed
towards port in order to obtain the highest price for the fish. Since the deck
crew were paid on a share basis, every minute counted in getting the catch
ready for sale. In charge of the engine room was the "driver" who
kept the steam engine going full speed. The fireman was kept very busy stoking
the boiler with coal. During hauling operations, if the catch was good, the
engineer could "scum" the herring that dropped out of the nets. In doing
so he earned what was known as "stoker", which was shared between
himself, the fireman and the cook. The fireman also took his turn out of the
engine room during the time the boat was fish­ing. His task was to coil the
leader rope on to which the nets were tied. This was a very monotonous job,
lasting hours on end and it took place in a small locker room in the fore part
of the vessel.

Cooking for nine or ten men was no easy task. As the nets were hauled in the cook's job was to pull in
the "sol-rope" which was the lower part of the net. After the nets
were aboard the crew had to be fed. Every second morning he would clean three
dozen fresh herring and fry them for breakfast. Cooking was done in the galley
on a coal-fired stove and space was limited. Three of the crew members were
paid a weekly wage. The engineer received around £1 10s (£1.50), the fire­man
around £1 5s (£1.25) and the same for the cook. On top of this was the sum
received for the herring mentioned before which provided these three men with
"stoker".

This was not a popular season and often produced mixed results. From April to
June or July the herring would be "swimming" in the North, so the
boats were based in the Shetlands at Balta­sound or Lerwick. This was a very
important season attracting boats from all the fishing towns, including English
ports. Many land based fish curing firms came to Shetland, employing women from

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">to gut and pack
the lovely large fish. There was also a base at Stronsay in Orkney. The months
of June till September saw the fish move to an area which could be reached by
boats from</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Wick, the </span><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Moray Firth</span></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB"> ports, Fraserburgh

In the autumn a large contingent went to </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">East Anglia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span lang="EN-GB">, to the ports of Great Yarmouth and </span><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Lowestoft</span></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">. Some haddock line
boats worked locally during the winter with a few bigger boats going to the
"great lines" fishing for cod, ling, tusk, skate and halibut. Often
the fishing season was a failure due to bad markets and lack of herring.</span></p>
