<br/>
<p class="Default"><span class="GramE"><b><span>The Inward Principle of Prayer.</span></b></span><b></b></p>
<br/>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span class="GramE"><span>'In the Spirit.<span>'</span></span></span></p>
<br/>
<p class="Default"><b><span>[To pray in the spirit, we
must have SINCERITY.] </span></b></p>
<p class="Default"><span class="GramE"><b><span>Third</span></b> <span>We pray in
the spirit when we pray in sincerity. There may be much fervour where there is
little or no sincerity. And this is strange fire; the heat of <span class="GramE">a distemper</span>, not the kindly natural heat of the new
creature, which both comes from God and acts for God; whereas the other is from
self, and ends in self. Indeed the fire which self kindles serves only to warm
the man's own hands by it that makes it: </span><span>'</span><span>Behold,
all you that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves about with sparks,</span><span>' </span><span>Isaiah 50:11; the prophet represents them as sitting
down about the fire they had made. Self-acting and self-aiming ever go
together; therefore our Saviour with spirit requires truth. He </span><span>'</span><span>seeks such to worship him</span><span>' </span><span>as will </span><span>'</span><span>worship him in spirit and in truth,</span><span>' </span><span>John 4:23, 24. <o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p class="Default"><span class="GramE"><b><span>Question.</span></b></span><span>
But wherein <span class="GramE">consists</span> this sincere fervency? <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default"><b><span>Answer.</span></b><span> Zeal intends the
affections, sincerity directs their end, and consists in their purity and <span class="SpellE">incorruption</span>. The blood is oft hot when none of the purest,
and affections strong when the heart insincere; therefore the apostle exhorts
us that we </span><span>'</span><span>love one another out of a pure heart fervently,</span><span>' </span><span>I Peter 1:22, and speaks in another place of </span><span>'</span><span>sorrowing after a godly sort,</span><span>' </span><span>that is, sincerely. Now the sincerity of the heart in
prayer then appears when a person is real in his <span class="GramE">prayers,</span>
and that from pure principles to pure ends. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default"><span class="GramE"><b><span>First.</span></b></span><span>
When he is real in what he presents to God in prayer. The index of his tongue
without and the clockwork of his heart within go together; he does not declaim
against a sin with his lips which he favours with his heart; he does not make a
loud cry for that grace which he would be sorry to have granted him. This is
the true badge of a hypocrite, who oft would be loath {that} God should take
him at his word. A dismal day it would be to such when God shall bring in their
own conscience to witness against them that their hearts never signed and
sealed the requests which they made. There is a state-policy used sometimes by
princes to send ambassadors, and set treaties on foot, when nothing less than
peace is intended. Such a deceit is to be found in the false heart of man, to
blind and cover secret purposes of war and rebellion against God with fair
overtures in prayer to him for peace. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default"><b><span>Second.</span></b><span> When the person is not
only real in what he desires, but this from a pure principle to a pure end. I
doubt not but a hypocrite in confession may have a real trouble upon his spirit
for his sins, and cordially, yea passionately, desire his pardoning mercy; but
not from a pure principle</span><span>-</span><span>a hatred of sin </span><span>-</span><span>but
an <span class="SpellE">abhorrency</span> of wrath he sees hastening to him for
it; not for a pure end, that the glory of God</span><span>'</span><span>s mercy may be magnified in and by him, but that himself may not be
tormented by God</span><span>'</span><span>s just wrath. He may desire the graces of his Spirit,
but not out of any love to them, but only as an expedient, without which he
knows to hell he must go; as a sick man in exquisite torture</span><span>-</span><span>suppose of the stone or some other acute disease</span><span>-</span><span>calls for some potion he loathes, because he knows he
cannot have ease except he drinks it. <span class="GramE">Whereas the sincere
soul desires grace, not only as physic, but food.</span> He craves it not only
as necessary but as sweet to his palate. The <span class="SpellE">intrinsical</span>
bounty and <span class="SpellE">excellency</span> of holiness inflames him with
such a love to it, that, as one taken with the beauty of a virgin, says he will
marry her though he hath nothing with her but the clothes to her back; so the
sincere heart would have holiness though it brought no other advantages with it
than what is found in its own lovely nature. So much to show what sincerity in
prayer is. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default"><span>Now he that would pray
acceptably must pray thus in his spirit, that is, with the sincerity of his
spirit. </span><span>'</span><span>The prayer of the upright is his delight.</span><span>' </span><span class="SpellE"><span>Nadab</span></span><span> and <span class="SpellE">Abihu</span> brought fire, and
had fire, </span><span>'</span><span>a strange fire,</span><span>' </span><span>to
destroy them for the </span><span>'</span><span>strange fire</span><span>' </span><span>they
offered; and such is all fervency and zeal that is not taken from the altar of
a sincere heart, Leviticus 10:1. </span><span>'</span><span>The
fervent prayer</span><span>
'</span><span>avails much.</span><span>' </span><span>It can do much, but it must be of a righteous man, and
such the sincere man only is. And no wonder that God stands so much upon
sincerity in prayer, seeing the lip of truth is so prized even among men.
Nature hath taught men to commend their words to others by laying their hands
on their breasts, as an assurance that what they say or promise is true and
cordial; which the penitent publican it is like aimed at, he </span><span>'</span><span>smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a
sinner,</span><span>'
</span><span>Luke 18:13, thereby declaring whence his
sorrowful confession came. That light which told the heathens that God must be
worshipped, informed them also this worship must come from the inward recesses
of the heart. <i>What care the gods for
gold! <span class="GramE">let</span> us offer that which is more worth than all
treasures, the heart and inward affections of it. </i>It is a strange custom <span class="SpellE">Benzo</span>, in his <span class="SpellE"><i>Historia</i></span><i> Novi <span class="SpellE">Orbis</span></i>, relates of the natives there: <i>the West Indians, when worshipping their
gods, used, by putting a little stick down their throat, to provoke themselves
to vomit, thereby showing their idol that they carried no secret evil within
them</i>. I should not have named this barbarous custom but to show how deeply
this notion is <span class="SpellE">engraven</span> in the natural conscience</span><span>-</span><span>that we must be sincere in the worship of God. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default"><span class="GramE"><b><span>Use.</span></b></span><span>
Let it put us upon the trial whether we thus pray in the spirit</span><span>-</span><span>whether you can find sincerity stamped on your
fervency. If the prayer be not fervent it cannot be sincere, but it may have <span class="GramE">a fervour</span> without this. This is a very fine sieve; approve yourself
here, and you may without presumption write yourself a saint. But how fervent <span class="SpellE">soever</span> you are without sincerity, it matters not. Nay, zeal
without uprightness is worse than key-cold; none will go to hell with more
shame than the false-hearted zealot, who mounts up towards heaven in the fiery
chariot, a seeming zeal, but at last is found a devil in Samuel</span><span>'</span><span>s mantle, and so is thrown down like lightning from
heaven, whither he would have been thought by his neighbours to be going. Be
not loath to be searched. Then there will then need no further search to prove
thee unsound. If God</span><span>'</span><span>s officer be denied entrance, all is not right within.
Now to help thee in the work, inquire</span><span>- <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default"><span class="GramE"><b><span>[R</span></b><b><span>ULES </span></b><b><span>for trying the sincerity of our hearts in prayer.]</span></b></span><b></b></p>
<p class="Default"><span class="GramE"><b><span>Rule 1.</span></b></span><b></b><span>What
is your care in performing this duty of prayer in secret? If your heart be
sincere, it will delight in privacy. A false heart calls others to see his zeal
for God. May be he is forward to put himself upon duty where he hath spectators
to applaud him, and can be very hot and earnest at the work; but wither he is
wholly a stranger to secret prayer, or else he is cold in the performance; he
finds himself becalmed now he wants the breath of others to fill his sails. The
plummets are off which quickened his motion, and he moves heavily to what he
did before company. Whereas a sincere Christian never finds more freedom of
spirit, and liquefactions of soul, than in his solitary addresses to God.
Joseph, when he would give full vent to his passion, sought some secret place
where to weep, and therefore retired himself into his chamber, Genesis 43:30.
So the sincere Christian goes to his closet, and there eases his heart into the
bosom of God, and lets his passions of sorrow for sin, and love to Christ,
burst forth and have their full scope, which in public prayer he restrains </span><span>-</span><span>as to the outward expression of them</span><span>-</span><span>out of a holy modesty, and fear of being observed by
others, which he hunts not for. Now speak, Christian, what is your temper? Can your
closet witness for thee in this particular? It is the trick of a hypocrite to
strain himself to the utmost in duty when he hath spectators, and to draw loose
in his gears when alone; like some that carry their best meat to market, and
save the worst for their own food at home; and others that draw their best wine
to their customers, but drink the dead and flat themselves at their own private
table. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default"><span class="GramE"><b><span>Rule 2.</span></b></span><span>
Observe yourself in your more public addresses to the throne of grace: and that
in two particulars. (1.) When you pray before others. (2.) When you join with
others that pray. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default"><span>(1.) When you pray before
others, observe on what you bestow your chief care and zeal, whether in the
externals or internals of prayer</span><span>-</span><span>that which is
exposed to the eye and ear of men, or that which should be prepared for the eye
and ear of God; the devout posture of your body, or the inward devotion of your
soul; the pomp of your words, or the power of your faith; the agitation of your
bodily spirits in the <span class="SpellE">vehemency</span> of your voice, or the
fervency of your spirit in heart-breaking affections. These inward workings of
the soul in prayer are the very soul of prayer; and all the care about the
other without this, is like the trimming bestowed upon a dead body</span><span>-</span><span>that will not make the carcass sweet, nor these your
prayer to God</span><span>'</span><span>s nostrils. It is the faith, love, brokenness of heart
for sin, and the inward affections exerted in prayer, that, like Elijah in his
fiery chariot, mount up to God in the heavens, while the other, with the
prophet</span><span>'</span><span>s mantle, <span class="GramE">fall</span> to the ground.
The sincere soul dares not be rude in his outward posture. He is careful of his
very words and phrase, that they may be grave and pertinent. Neither would he
pray them asleep that joins with him, by a cold, dreaming, and lazy manner of
delivering of it; but still, it is the inward disposition of his heart he
principally looks to, knowing well, that by the other he is but cook to others,
and may fast himself if his own heart be idle in the duty; and there-fore he
does not count he prays well</span><span>-</span><span>though to the
affecting of their hearts</span><span>-</span><span>except he finds his own affections drawn out in the
duty. Whereas the hypocrite, if he may but come off the duty with the applause
of others in the external performance, is very well pleased, though he be
conscious of the deadness and naughtiness of his own heart therein. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default"><span>(2.) When you join with others
that pray. Do the gifts and graces that breathe from others in prayer warm your
affections, and draw out your soul to bear them company to heaven in the
petitions they put up? Or do they stir up a secret envying and repining at the
gifts of God bestowed on them? This would discover much pride and unsoundness
in your spirit. The hypocrite is proud, and thinks all the water is spilt and
lost that runs beside his own mill; whereas the sincere soul prizes the gifts
of others, can heartily bless God for them, and make a humble and holy use of
them. His heart is as much affected with the holy savoury requests that another
puts up, as when they come out of his own mouth. But the hypocrite's eye is
evil, because God</span><span>'</span><span>s is good. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default"><span class="GramE"><b><span>Rule 3.</span></b></span><span>
Observe whether your fervency in prayer be uniform. A false heart may seem very
hot in praying against one sin; but he can skip over another, and either <span class="GramE">leave</span> it out of his confession, or handles it very gently.
As a partial witness, that would fain save the prisoner</span><span>'</span><span>s life he comes against, will not speak all he knows,
but minces his evidence; thus does the hypocrite deal with his darling <span class="GramE">lust.</span> He is like one that mows grass with a gapped scythe;
some he cuts down, and other he leaves standing; vehement against this, and
favourable to that lust; whereas sincerity makes clear work as it goes. </span><span>'</span><span>Order my steps in your word: and let not any iniquity
have dominion over me,</span><span>'
</span><span>Psalm 119:133. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default"><span>Again
the false heart is as uneven in his petitions as in his deprecations. Very
earnest he is for some mercies, and they are commonly of an inferior nature,
but more indifferent in his desires for those that are greater; he tithes mint
and <span class="SpellE">cummin</span> in his prayers </span><span>-</span><span>temporal mercies, I mean</span><span>-</span><span>but neglects the weightier things of the promise</span><span>-</span><span>the sanctifying graces of the Spirit, humility,
heavenly-mindedness, contentment, self-denial; a little of these upon a knife</span><span>'</span><span>s point will content him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default"><span class="GramE"><b><span>Rule 4.</span></b></span><span>
Observe whether your endeavours correspond with your prayers. The false heart
seems hot in prayer, but you will find him cold enough at work. He prays very
fiercely against his sins, as if he desired them to be all slain upon the
place; but what does <span class="GramE">he</span> towards the speeding of them
with his own hands? Does he set himself upon the work of mortification? <span class="GramE">does</span> he withdraw the fuel that feeds them? <span class="GramE">is</span> he careful to shun occasions that may ensnare him? When
temptations come, do they find him in arms upon his guard, resolved to resist
their motion? Alas! <span class="GramE">no</span> such matter. If a few good
words in prayer will do the work, well and good; but as for any more, he is too
lazy to go about it. Whereas the sincere heart is not idle after prayer; when
it hath given heaven the alarm, and called God in to his help, then he takes
the field himself, and opposes his lusts with all his might, watching their
motions, and taking every advantage he meets with to fall upon them. Every
mercy he receives, he beats it out into a weapon, to knock down all thoughts of
sinning again. Thus, </span><span>'</span><span>Seeing that you our God has punished us less than our
iniquities deserve, and has given us such deliverance as this; should we again
break your commandments?</span><span>'
</span><span>Ezra 9:13, 14. O God forbid, says the holy
soul, that he should bid such a thought welcome! Every promise he reads, he
lifts it up as a sword for his defence against this enemy. </span><span>'</span><span>Having these promises, let us cleanse ourselves,</span><span>' </span><span>2 Corinthians 7:1. I shall shut up this head with a few
directions how we may get this sincere heart in prayer. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default"><b><span>[How we may get this sincerity in prayer.] <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="Default"><span>(1.) Get your heart united by
faith to Christ. It is faith that purifies the heart from its false principles
and ends in duty. </span><span>'</span><span>God made man upright;</span><span>' </span><span>and, while he stood so, his eye and foot went right; neither did his eye
look or his foot tread awry. But after Eve had talked with the serpent, she and
all mankind after her learned the serpent</span><span>'</span><span>s
crooked motion, to look one way and go another. </span><span>'</span><span>God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions,</span><span>' </span><span class="SpellE"><span>Ecc</span></span><span>. 7:29. O beg therefore, with David, that God would </span><span>'</span><span>renew a right spirit within thee,</span><span>' </span><span>Psalm 51:10. What the evil spirit hath perverted the
Holy Spirit alone can set right. If the cause why a piece carries wrong be in
its make and mould, it must be new cast, or it will never carry right.
Hypocrisy in duty comes from the falseness of man</span><span>'</span><span>s depraved nature; the heart therefore must be made new before it can be
sincere. The new heart is the single heart, </span><span>'</span><span>I
will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you,</span><span>' </span><span>Ezekiel 11:19. He that loves </span><span>'</span><span>truth in the inward parts</span><span>' </span><span>can put it there. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default"><span>(2.) Make hypocrisy in prayer
appear as odious to you as possibly you can; and you need not dress it up in
any other than its own clothes to do this. Consider but how grievous a sin and
how great a folly it is, and methinks it were enough to set thee against it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default"><span>(a) Consider what a grievous sin
it is. A lie spoken by one man to another is a sin capable of high
aggravations; what then is that lie which is uttered in prayer to God? Surely
this must be much more horrid, for here is blasphemy in the untruth. God spares
not to give the hypocrite the lie, </span><span>'</span><span>Ephraim
compasses me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit,</span><span>' </span></p>
<p class="Default"><span>Hosea 11:12; so many lies they
told to God, as prayers they put up. O the patience of a God that does not
strike the hypocrite dead upon the place, while the lie is in his throat, as he
did <span class="SpellE">Ananias</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sapphira</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default"><span>(b) Consider what a great folly
it is. [1.] As it is infeasible. Who but a fool can think to blind the eyes of
the Almighty? Canst you cover the eye of the sun with your hand or <span class="GramE">hat, that</span> it shall not shine? <span class="GramE">as</span>
unable are you to hide your secret designs so close that the great God should
not see them. [2.] As it is impossible to deceive God, so you put a woeful
cheat upon yourself. You think you mend the matter by praying, and you make it
worse. When you come on your trial for your life, your hypocrisy in prayer will
cost you dearer than your other sins. You take pains to increase your
condemnation; you dost, as Solomon says of another kind of hypocrite, Proverbs
1:18, </span><span>'</span><span>lay wait for your own blood; they lurk <span class="SpellE">privily</span> for your own life.</span><span>' </span><span>Of all sinners, the hypocrite hath the <span class="SpellE">precedency</span>
in God</span><span>'</span><span>s purposes and preparations of wrath. Hell is prepared
for them as the firstborn of damnation. Other sinners are said to have their </span><span>'</span><span>portion with hypocrites,</span><span>' </span><span>as the younger brethren with their elder, who is the heir, Matthew
24:51. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default"><span>(3.) Crucify your affections to
the world. Hypocrisy in religion springs from the bitter root of some carnal <span class="GramE">affections</span> <span class="SpellE">unmortified</span>. So long as
your prey lies below, your eye will be to the earth, even when you seem like an
eagle to mount in your prayers to heaven. The false heart - uses religion for
secular ends, and makes his seeming piety to God but as a horsing-block to get
into the creature</span><span>'</span><span>s saddle. God is in his mouth, but the world is in his
heart; which he projects to attain more easily by the reputation that this will
gain him. I have read of one that offered his prince a great sum of money for
no more but to have his leave once or twice a day to come into his presence,
and only say, </span><span>'</span><span>God save your majesty.</span><span>' </span><span>The prince, wondering at this large offer for so small a favour, asked
him what this would advantage <span class="GramE">him?</span> O sir, says he,
this, though I have nothing else at your hands, will get me a name in the
country for one that is a great favourite at court, and such an opinion will
help me to more by the year's end than I am out for the purchase. Thus some, it
is to be feared, by the very name which they get for great saints among their
neighbours, from their acquaintance with religious duties, do facilitate their
carnal projects, and advance their worldly interest, that lie at the bottom of
all their goodly profession. Well, Christian, this is but to play at small game</span><span>-</span><span>to fish for any of the world's petty enjoyments with
religion</span><span>'</span><span>s golden hook. As you <span class="SpellE">lovest</span> your
soul, and wouldst not lose this for ever, to get that which you must lose after
you hast got it, mortify those carnal affections which you finds most likely to
withdraw your heart from God. You know not God, if you see not enough in him to
make you happy without the world's contributions. This, thoroughly believed,
will make you sincere in his service. </span><span class="GramE"><span>'</span><span>I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be perfect,</span><span>' </span><span>Genesis 17:1.</span></span></p>
