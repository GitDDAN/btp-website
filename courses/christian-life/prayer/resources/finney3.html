<h2>The Spirit Leads Christians in Prayer</h2>
<p>The Spirit leads Christians to desire and pray for things of which nothing is specifically said in the Word of God. Take the case of an individual:</p>
<ul>
<li>That God is willing to save is a general truth.</li>
<li>So it is a general truth that He is willing to answer prayer.</li>
</ul>
<p>But how shall I know the will of God respecting that individual - whether I can pray in faith according to the will of God for the conversion and salvation of that individual, or not?</p>
<p>Here the agency of the Spirit comes in to lead the minds of God's people to pray for those individuals, and at those times, when God is prepared to bless them.</p>
<blockquote>
                                When we know not what to pray for, the Holy Spirit leads the mind to dwell on some object, to consider its situation, to realize its value, and to feel for it, and pray, and 'travail in birth,' till the person is converted.
                            </blockquote>
<p>This sort of experience, I know, is less common in cities than it is in some parts of the country, because of the infinite number of things which in cities divert the attention and grieve the Spirit.</p>
<p>I have had much opportunity to know how it has been in some districts.</p>
<h3>Praying for Individuals Under the Leadership of the Holy Spirit</h3>
<p>I was acquainted with an individual who used to keep a list of persons for whom he was especially concerned; and I have had the opportunity to know a multitude of persons, for whom he became thus interested, who were immediately converted. I have seen him pray for persons on his list when he was literally in an agony for them; and have sometimes known him call on some other person to help him pray for such a one. I have known his mind to fasten thus on an individual of hardened, abandoned character, and who could not be reached in any ordinary way.</p>
<h3>An Example of Spirit-Led Prayer</h3>
<p>In a town in a north part of this State, where there was a revival, there was a certain individual who was a most violent and outrageous opposer. He kept a tavern, and used to delight in swearing at a desperate rate, whenever there were Christians within hearing, on purpose to hurt their feelings. He was so bad that one man said he believed he should have to sell his place, or give it away, and move out of town, for he could not live near a man who swore so.</p>
<p>This good man of whom I was speaking passed through the town, and, hearing of the case, was very much grieved and distressed for the individual. He took him on his praying list. The case weighed on his mind when he was asleep and when he was awake. He kept thinking about the ungodly man, and praying for him for days.</p>
<p><strong>And, the first we knew of it, the tavern keeper came into a meeting, got up and confessed his sins, and poured out his soul. His barroom immediately became the place where they held prayer meetings.</strong></p>
<p>In this manner the Spirit of God leads individual Christians to pray for things which they would not pray for, unless they were led by the Spirit; and thus they pray for things 'according to the will of God.'</p>
