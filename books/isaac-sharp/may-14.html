<h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2">Isaac Sharp and Asbjorn Kloster in the Faroe Islands (April June 1862)</h4>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Journal of Isaac Sharp - May 14, 1862</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Left Videroe(Videreidi)at eight, after breakfast, and walked across the island to Eastwick(Eidsvik), thereby shortening the sea voyage considerably, and embarked at nine o'clock. The little inlet was rocky and steep, and the point of embarkation covered with weed. The boat rose and fell considerably, and it felt somewhat new and strange when one of the crew thoughtfully passed a rope under my arms to provide for any emergency. A few minutes sufficed, and the boat was pushed off from the rocky ledge. The mountains of Videroe(Videreidi)look fine from the sea. To the north is a commanding precipice, rising abruptly from the ocean with a tapering summit. The effect was greatly heightened by a dash of prismatic tint, blending with the green and grey with a softened glow of loveliness not often seen. We had not been long from land before the wind and waves arose with sudden violence; the current at the same time being very strong; and now and then came a lurch threatening to overwhelm. There were a few moments of deep thoughtfulness; I think it may be safely said they were moments both of the trial and renewal of faith, with ability to commit all as into the hands of a faithful Creator.</p>
<h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Fugloy (Kirkja and Hattervik)</h3>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">As we drew near to Fugloe(Fugloy), the current was less; but such a place for landing we had never seen before. From the heights above, the men came down and quickly gave us their greeting, "We are surprised to see you come here in such weather."Now came the ascent of the rocks, in which a footstep was chiselled here and there, and soon we looked down on the waves below, and watched the contending waters in the middle of the fiord which separates Fugloe(Fugloy)from the adjoining isle. We were kindly welcomed to the house of one of the peasants; and, notice having been given, about fifty persons assembled at twelve o'clock. All were respectful, civil, and attentive. Ability was granted to my valued companion andmyselfto plead with them concerning their soul's best welfare and the way of life and death. After partaking of some refreshment, we passed over the high land on foot, and descended the little valley to Hattersvik(Hattarvik), a smaller hamlet than the one at which we landed. At six o'clock, about twenty-four assembled, to whom power was given us to preach the gospel of reconciliation through Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">On coming to this distant island, no impediment appeared to present in the knowledge that we might be detained by stress of weather, and in the morning the sky had a very storm-like appearance; the evening, on the contrary, was calm and still. Between 10 and 11 P.M., there were some remains of daylight, about which time the moon arose from the ocean's bed like a ball of fire, resembling the setting sun seen through a mist. The effect was very fine.</p>
