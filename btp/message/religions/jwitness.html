is how all the cults use scriptures to defend their doctrines. Scripture must be rightly divided by

<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="GramE"><span lang="EN-GB">By using individual texts to support their doctrines the <span class="SpellE">JW's</span> claim to have a greater knowledge of scripture than

the name is Jehovah. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">There is no evidence to support the claim of JW's regarding the pronunciation of the tetragrammaton name of God. It is more likely that the name was pronounced as Yahweh.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-GB">Introductory Story</span></b><span lang="EN-GB">: Taking
scripture out of context</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">One time some Jehovah's Witnesses came to my door.I told them that Jesus is the eternal Son of
God and is also called Jehovah (YHWH) in the scriptures. One of the Jehovah's Witnesses immediately
quoted the scripture to me 'The Father is greater than I'. He then argued that Jesus said the Father
(Jehovah) is greater than He is, then how can Jesus be the eternal Son of
God?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">My answer was that scripture must be understood within the context
of scripture and that Jesus was speaking as the Son of Man to His Father but He
was still the eternal Son of God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">'Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and today and forever', (<span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref">Hebrews

2:5-11</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> gives the answer. Jesus humbled
Himself and became a servant. Jesus in
his humiliation could say 'The Father is greater than I' because He made
Himself subject to the will of the Father. He was not inferior in His nature and character. He could say 'Before Abraham was I AM'. In this way He claimed to be the eternal God
Jehovah. The Jews sought to kill Him for
this. </span></p>

<p><b>The New World Translation of the Bible.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="SpellE"><span lang="EN-GB">JW's</span></span><span lang="EN-GB"> produced a new translation of
the Bible:</span></p>
<p>The New World Translation New Testament was first published in 1950. The complete Bible was published in 1961.</p>
<p>The translaters of this Bible are anonymous. This makes it impossible to know how qualified the translators were to translate the scriptures from Hebrew and Greek. It is evident that the teaching of the JW's has influenced the translation.</p>
<p>An example of this is found in<span class="scripture-ref"> <span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref">John 1:1</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> which is incorrectly translated 'the word was a god'. This translation is used by JW's to deny the deity of Christ.</p>
<p>Explanation</p>
<p><i>God</i> (theos) is the predicate describing the subject <i>word</i>. It is not necessary to put a definite article with a predicate.</p>
<p>In addition to this greater emphasis is placed upon the deity of Christ in the Greek by the word order of the phrase 'the word was God'. The predicate nominative 'God' stands at the beginning of the phrase to emphasise its meaning.</p>
