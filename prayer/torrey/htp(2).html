UNTO GOD <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>We
have seen something of the tremendous importance and the resistless power of
prayer, and now we come directly to the question--how to pray with power. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>1.
In the 12th chapter of the Acts of the Apostles we have the record of a prayer
that prevailed with God, and brought to pass great results. In the 5th verse of
this chapter, the manner and method of this prayer is described in few words: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>"Prayer
was made without ceasing of the church UNTO GOD for him." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>The
first thing to notice in this verse is the brief expression "unto
God." The prayer that has power is the prayer that is offered unto God. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>But
some will say, "Is not all prayer unto God?" <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>No.
Very much of so-called prayer, both public and private, is not unto God. In
order that a prayer should be really unto God, there must be a definite and
conscious approach to God when we pray; we must have a definite and vivid
realization that God is bending over us and listening as we pray. <span class="GramE">In very much of our prayer there is really but little thought of
God.</span> Our mind is taken up with the thought of what we need, and is not
occupied with the thought of the mighty and loving Father of whom we are
seeking it. Oftentimes it is the case that we <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4" style="page-break-before:always"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>are</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> occupied neither
with the need nor with the One to whom we are praying, but our mind is
wandering here and there <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>throughout</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> the world. There is no power in that sort
of prayer. But when we really come into God's presence, really meet Him face to
face in the place of prayer, really seek the things that we desire FROM HIM, <span class="GramE">then</span> there is power. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>If,
then, we would pray aright, the first thing that we should do is to see to it
that we really get an audience with God, that we really get into His very
presence. Before a word of petition <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>is</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> offered, we should have the definite and vivid
consciousness that we are talking to God, and should believe that He is
listening to our petition and is going to grant the thing that we ask of Him.
This is only possible by the Holy Spirit's power, so we should look to the Holy
Spirit to really lead us into the presence of God, and should not be hasty in
words until He has actually brought us there. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>One
night a very active Christian man dropped into a little prayer-meeting that I
was leading. Before we knelt to pray, I said something like the above, telling
all the friends to be sure before they prayed, and while they were <span class="GramE">praying,</span> that they really were in God's presence, that they
had the thought of Him definitely in mind, and to be more taken up with Him
than with their petition. A few days after I met this same gentleman, and he
said that this simple thought was entirely new to him, that it had made prayer
an entirely new experience to him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>If
then we would pray aright, these two little words must sink deep into our
hearts, "UNTO GOD." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>2.
The second secret of effective praying is found in the same verse, in the words
"WITHOUT CEASING." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>In
the Revised Version, "without ceasing" is rendered
"earnestly." Neither rendering gives the full force of the Greek. The
word means literally "stretched-out-ed-<span class="SpellE">ly</span>."
It is a pictorial <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>word</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>, and wonderfully expressive. It represents
the soul on a stretch of earnest and intense desire. "Intensely"
would perhaps come as near translating it as any English word. It is the word
used <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>of</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> our Lord in Luke 22:44 where it is said, "He
prayed more earnestly: and His sweat was as it were great drops of blood
falling down to the ground." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>We
read in Heb. 5:7 that "in the days of His flesh" Christ "offered
up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears." In Rom. 15:30,
Paul beseeches the saints in Rome to STRIVE together with him in their prayers.
The word translated "strive" means primarily to contend as in
athletic games or in a fight. In other words, the prayer that prevails with God
is the prayer into which we put our whole soul, stretching out toward God in
intense and agonizing desire. Much of our modern prayer has no power in it
because there is no heart in it. We rush into God's presence, run through a
string of petitions, jump up and go out. If someone should ask us an hour
afterward for what we prayed, oftentimes we could not tell. If we put so little
heart into our prayers, we cannot expect God to put much heart into answering
them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>We
hear much in our day of the rest of faith, but there is such a thing as the
fight of faith in prayer as well as in effort. Those who would have us think
that they have attained to some sublime <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4" style="page-break-before:always"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>height of faith and trust because they never
know any agony of conflict or of prayer, have surely gotten beyond their Lord,
and beyond the mightiest victors for God, both in effort and prayer, that <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>the</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> ages of Christian history have known. When
we learn to come to God with an intensity of desire that wrings the soul, then
shall we know a power in prayer that most of us do not know <span class="GramE">now.</span>
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>But
how shall we attain to this earnestness in prayer? <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Not
by trying to work ourselves up into it. The true method is explained in Rom.
8:26, "And in like manner the Spirit also <span class="SpellE">helpeth</span>
our infirmity: for we know not how to pray as we ought; but the Spirit Himself <span class="SpellE">maketh</span> intercession for us with <span class="SpellE">groanings</span>
which cannot be uttered." <span class="GramE">(R.V.)</span> The earnestness
that we work up in the energy of the flesh is a repulsive thing. The
earnestness wrought in us by the power of the Holy Spirit is pleasing to God.
Here again, if we would pray aright, we must look to the Spirit of God to teach
us to pray. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>It
is in this connection that fasting comes. In Dan. 9:3 we read that Daniel set
his face "unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with
fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes." There <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>are</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> those who think that fasting belongs to the
old dispensation; but when we look at Acts 14:23, and Acts 13:2,3, we find that
it was practised by the earnest men of the apostolic day. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>If
we would pray with power, we should pray with fasting. This of course does not
mean that we should fast every time we pray; but there are times of emergency
or special crisis in work or in our individual lives, when men of downright
earnestness will withdraw themselves even from the gratification of natural
appetites that would be perfectly proper under other circumstances, that they
may give themselves up wholly to prayer. There is a peculiar power in such
prayer. Every great crisis in life and work should be met in that way. There is
nothing pleasing to God in our giving up in a purely Pharisaic and legal way
things which are pleasant, but there is power in that downright earnestness and
determination to obtain in prayer the things of which we sorely feel our need,
that leads us to put away everything, even the things in themselves most right
and <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>necessary</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>, that we may set our faces to find God, and
obtain blessings from Him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>3.
A third secret of right praying is also found in this same verse, Acts 12:5. It
appears in the three words "OF THE CHURCH." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>There
is power in UNITED PRAYER. Of course there is power in the prayer of an
individual, but there is vastly increased power in united prayer. God delights
in the unity of His people, and seeks to emphasize it in every way, and so He
pronounces a special blessing <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>upon</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> united prayer. We read in Matt. 18:19,
"If two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall
ask, it shall be done for them of My Father which is in heaven." This
unity, however, must be real. The passage just quoted does not say that if two
shall agree in asking, but if two shall agree AS TOUCHING anything they shall
ask. Two persons might agree to ask for the same thing, and yet there be no
real agreement as touching the thing they asked. One might ask it because he
really desired <span class="GramE">it,</span> the other might ask it simply to
please his friend. But where there is real agreement, where the Spirit of God
brings two believers into perfect harmony as concerning that which they may ask
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4" style="page-break-before:always"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>of</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> God, where the
Spirit lays the same burden on two hearts; in all such prayer there is
absolutely irresistible power. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

In the 12th chapter of the Acts of the Apostles we have the record of a prayer
that prevailed with God, and brought to pass great results. In the 5th verse of
this chapter, the manner and method of this prayer is described in few words: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>"Prayer
was made without ceasing of the church UNTO GOD for him." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>The
first thing to notice in this verse is the brief expression "unto
God." The prayer that has power is the prayer that is offered unto God. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>But
some will say, "Is not all prayer unto God?" <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>No.
Very much of so-called prayer, both public and private, is not unto God. In
order that a prayer should be really unto God, there must be a definite and
conscious approach to God when we pray; we must have a definite and vivid
realization that God is bending over us and listening as we pray. <span class="GramE">In very much of our prayer there is really but little thought of
God.</span> Our mind is taken up with the thought of what we need, and is not
occupied with the thought of the mighty and loving Father of whom we are
seeking it. Oftentimes it is the case that we <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4" style="page-break-before:always"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>are</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> occupied neither
with the need nor with the One to whom we are praying, but our mind is
wandering here and there <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>throughout</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> the world. There is no power in that sort
of prayer. But when we really come into God's presence, really meet Him face to
face in the place of prayer, really seek the things that we desire FROM HIM, <span class="GramE">then</span> there is power. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>If,
then, we would pray aright, the first thing that we should do is to see to it
that we really get an audience with God, that we really get into His very
presence. Before a word of petition <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>is</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> offered, we should have the definite and vivid
consciousness that we are talking to God, and should believe that He is
listening to our petition and is going to grant the thing that we ask of Him.
This is only possible by the Holy Spirit's power, so we should look to the Holy
Spirit to really lead us into the presence of God, and should not be hasty in
words until He has actually brought us there. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>One
night a very active Christian man dropped into a little prayer-meeting that I
was leading. Before we knelt to pray, I said something like the above, telling
all the friends to be sure before they prayed, and while they were <span class="GramE">praying,</span> that they really were in God's presence, that they
had the thought of Him definitely in mind, and to be more taken up with Him
than with their petition. A few days after I met this same gentleman, and he
said that this simple thought was entirely new to him, that it had made prayer
an entirely new experience to him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>If
then we would pray aright, these two little words must sink deep into our
hearts, "UNTO GOD." <o:p></o:p></span></p>

The second secret of effective praying is found in the same verse, in the words
"WITHOUT CEASING." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>In
the Revised Version, "without ceasing" is rendered
"earnestly." Neither rendering gives the full force of the Greek. The
word means literally "stretched-out-ed-<span class="SpellE">ly</span>."
It is a pictorial <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>word</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>, and wonderfully expressive. It represents
the soul on a stretch of earnest and intense desire. "Intensely"
would perhaps come as near translating it as any English word. It is the word
used <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>of</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> our Lord in Luke 22:44 where it is said, "He
prayed more earnestly: and His sweat was as it were great drops of blood
falling down to the ground." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>We
read in Heb. 5:7 that "in the days of His flesh" Christ "offered
up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears." In Rom. 15:30,
Paul beseeches the saints in Rome to STRIVE together with him in their prayers.
The word translated "strive" means primarily to contend as in
athletic games or in a fight. In other words, the prayer that prevails with God
is the prayer into which we put our whole soul, stretching out toward God in
intense and agonizing desire. Much of our modern prayer has no power in it
because there is no heart in it. We rush into God's presence, run through a
string of petitions, jump up and go out. If someone should ask us an hour
afterward for what we prayed, oftentimes we could not tell. If we put so little
heart into our prayers, we cannot expect God to put much heart into answering
them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>We
hear much in our day of the rest of faith, but there is such a thing as the
fight of faith in prayer as well as in effort. Those who would have us think
that they have attained to some sublime <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4" style="page-break-before:always"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>height of faith and trust because they never
know any agony of conflict or of prayer, have surely gotten beyond their Lord,
and beyond the mightiest victors for God, both in effort and prayer, that <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>the</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> ages of Christian history have known. When
we learn to come to God with an intensity of desire that wrings the soul, then
shall we know a power in prayer that most of us do not know <span class="GramE">now.</span>
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>But
how shall we attain to this earnestness in prayer? <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Not
by trying to work ourselves up into it. The true method is explained in Rom.
8:26, "And in like manner the Spirit also <span class="SpellE">helpeth</span>
our infirmity: for we know not how to pray as we ought; but the Spirit Himself <span class="SpellE">maketh</span> intercession for us with <span class="SpellE">groanings</span>
which cannot be uttered." <span class="GramE">(R.V.)</span> The earnestness
that we work up in the energy of the flesh is a repulsive thing. The
earnestness wrought in us by the power of the Holy Spirit is pleasing to God.
Here again, if we would pray aright, we must look to the Spirit of God to teach
us to pray. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>It
is in this connection that fasting comes. In Dan. 9:3 we read that Daniel set
his face "unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with
fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes." There <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>are</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> those who think that fasting belongs to the
old dispensation; but when we look at Acts 14:23, and Acts 13:2,3, we find that
it was practised by the earnest men of the apostolic day. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>If
we would pray with power, we should pray with fasting. This of course does not
mean that we should fast every time we pray; but there are times of emergency
or special crisis in work or in our individual lives, when men of downright
earnestness will withdraw themselves even from the gratification of natural
appetites that would be perfectly proper under other circumstances, that they
may give themselves up wholly to prayer. There is a peculiar power in such
prayer. Every great crisis in life and work should be met in that way. There is
nothing pleasing to God in our giving up in a purely Pharisaic and legal way
things which are pleasant, but there is power in that downright earnestness and
determination to obtain in prayer the things of which we sorely feel our need,
that leads us to put away everything, even the things in themselves most right
and <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:

font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>, that we may set our faces to find God, and
obtain blessings from Him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>3.
A third secret of right praying is also found in this same verse, Acts 12:5. It
appears in the three words "OF THE CHURCH." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>There
is power in UNITED PRAYER. Of course there is power in the prayer of an
individual, but there is vastly increased power in united prayer. God delights
in the unity of His people, and seeks to emphasize it in every way, and so He
pronounces a special blessing <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>upon</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> united prayer. We read in Matt. 18:19,
"If two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall
ask, it shall be done for them of My Father which is in heaven." This
unity, however, must be real. The passage just quoted does not say that if two
shall agree in asking, but if two shall agree AS TOUCHING anything they shall
ask. Two persons might agree to ask for the same thing, and yet there be no
real agreement as touching the thing they asked. One might ask it because he
really desired <span class="GramE">it,</span> the other might ask it simply to
please his friend. But where there is real agreement, where the Spirit of God
brings two believers into perfect harmony as concerning that which they may ask

his face "unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with
fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes." There <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>are</span></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> those who think that fasting belongs to the
old dispensation; but when we look at Acts 14:23, and Acts 13:2,3, we find that
it was practised by the earnest men of the apostolic day. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>If
we would pray with power, we should pray with fasting. This of course does not
mean that we should fast every time we pray; but there are times of emergency
or special crisis in work or in our individual lives, when men of downright
earnestness will withdraw themselves even from the gratification of natural
appetites that would be perfectly proper under other circumstances, that they
may give themselves up wholly to prayer. There is a peculiar power in such
prayer. Every great crisis in life and work should be met in that way. There is
nothing pleasing to God in our giving up in a purely Pharisaic and legal way
things which are pleasant, but there is power in that downright earnestness and
determination to obtain in prayer the things of which we sorely feel our need,
that leads us to put away everything, even the things in themselves most right
and <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:

font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>, that we may set our faces to find God, and
obtain blessings from Him. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'><o:p> </o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>3.
A third secret of right praying is also found in this same verse, Acts 12:5. It
appears in the three words "OF THE CHURCH." <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>There
is power in UNITED PRAYER. Of course there is power in the prayer of an
individual, but there is vastly increased power in united prayer. God delights
in the unity of His people, and seeks to emphasize it in every way, and so He
pronounces a special blessing <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="Default text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="GramE"><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:

font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'> united prayer. We read in Matt. 18:19,
"If two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall
ask, it shall be done for them of My Father which is in heaven." This
unity, however, must be real. The passage just quoted does not say that if two
shall agree in asking, but if two shall agree AS TOUCHING anything they shall
ask. Two persons might agree to ask for the same thing, and yet there be no
real agreement as touching the thing they asked. One might ask it because he
really desired <span class="GramE">it,</span> the other might ask it simply to
please his friend. But where there is real agreement, where the Spirit of God
brings two believers into perfect harmony as concerning that which they may ask
