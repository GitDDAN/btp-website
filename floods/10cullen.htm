<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Fishing had for
decades been the only source of financial income for the Banffshire towns of
Cullen, <span class="SpellE">Portknockie</span> and <span class="SpellE">Findochty</span>.The inhabitants of these places were closely <span class="GramE">knit,</span> they rejoiced together in happy times and sorrowed
together in times of disaster.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Many left at the
annual exodus for the East <span class="SpellE">Anglian</span> fishing, indeed,
whole families made the journey south in order to <span class="GramE">either
catch</span>, gut or pack the silver darlings.Children of school age were taught in schools at </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Yarmouth</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> or </span><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Lowestoft</span></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">, while those under
five would be left in the care of friends or grandparents.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">These three towns
were to know a rich harvest, far beyond that which had been thought possible.Whole families were converted to Christ, even
before they returned north.When they
did arrive in their respective towns, the blessings received at </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Yarmouth</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> did not
subside, but flowed on and spread into the neighbouring villages and district.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The Christians of
Cullen, some who had been revived and others just saved, were to play a
prominent part in the move of the Holy Spirit in <span class="SpellE">Portsoy</span>
in 1923.When Captain William <span class="SpellE">Leed</span> and Lieutenant A. E. Towne, the Salvation Army
officers at Cullen decided to go to <span class="SpellE">Portsoy</span> for
meetings in March 1923, they were supported by a loyal band of Christians on
fire for God, from Cullen.These folks
were willing to cycle even in winter weather in order to tell their
neighbouring <span class="SpellE">townsfolks</span> of the One Who is mighty and
strong to save.No wonder <span class="SpellE">Portsoy</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sandend</span> and other villages
were moved by revival blessing and many were saved.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">There were others
who unashamedly blazed the trail for God, because wherever the men of <span class="SpellE">Portknockie</span> went in pursuit of their calling as fishermen,
they would fearlessly and fervently proclaim by life and lip that Christ is the
answer.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">One of the
well-known characters around the Banffshire fishing villages at that time was a
fisherman from <span class="SpellE">Portknockie</span> called John <span class="SpellE">Innes</span>.Saved at the
turn of the century, John was tall, of erect bearing, and could often be seen
standing alone at some street corner, holding forth the word of life.His preaching took its character from his way
of life and was invariably interspersed with quaint witticisms.Preaching in the days when radio was in its
infancy, he would say, "I'm always tuned in to glory."The words of the song he frequently sang
revealed how this man of God saw the journey of life as a voyage at sea, and
how one needed Jesus as a pilot.Those
who heard him sing said that he sang with conviction and the passion that only
a soul burdened for others could sing.This is his song:-</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span lang="EN-GB">For remember the short voyage of life will soon end."<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A few miles west
of <span class="SpellE">Portknockie</span> is the town known locally as "<span class="SpellE">Finichty</span>"<span class="GramE">.</span>Around the first two decades of the 20th
century <span class="SpellE">Findochty</span> contained some tremendous men and
women of God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">One such was James
Campbell, a Sergeant-major in the local Salvation Army Corps.James preached in his sea-boots in </span><st1:street><st1:address><span lang="EN-GB">Church Street</span></st1:address></st1:street><span lang="EN-GB">,
warning souls to "flee from the wrath to come".He later took a bad stroke which immobilized
him, but he was prayed for, got marvellously healed, <span class="GramE">then</span>
visited every home in the town and district.His prayer life was tremendous.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Another was James
"Callie" Campbell.Some of his
family did not enjoy a full measure of health, but this only drove those
saintly souls nearer to the Christ they loved.He proved God in these circumstances, because his faith in Christ was as
deep as the sea that he sailed in search of a modest living for his family.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">One man who was
always rejoicing in his Saviour was George <span class="SpellE">Flett</span>.Known locally as "Sailor", he
played his cornet in the Salvation Army meetings.He is reputed to have played his instrument
to the glory of God in every port he visited as a fisherman.His one-man, plus God, open air meetings were
well listened to.What a character for
Jesus, <span class="SpellE">Finlay</span> <span class="SpellE">flett</span>
was.With his boat, "Brae <span class="SpellE">Flett</span>", he moved to Wick, taking his whole family with
him, and proved his worth as a Salvationist.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It was a privilege
of mine to know another stalwart of these days of revival.I met Bill Bruce while I was conducting a
Gospel Campaign in a tent at <span class="SpellE">Buckie</span> in 1964.Immediately a great friendship was forged
between us.The sweetness of the
fellowship in his home with his dear wife "Lass" will live with me
for a long time.As I sat and drank in
the stories of triumphs for the Cross, my heart would just cry, "Lord, do
it again." These few men along with others stood for the truths of the
Gospel even before 1921.No wonder <span class="SpellE">Findochty</span> was especially blest when God moved amongst the
fisher folks.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The weekend after
the drifters had sailed for </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">East Anglia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span lang="EN-GB">, a Salvation Army Officer along with a mother and her young lassie
walked up the hill after the meeting in the Salvation Army Hall.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Then the captain
remarked that there were only eleven or twelve in the service due to the
fishing and lack of interest in spiritual things.Suddenly the three stopped in their tracks as
they realised the situation.They fell
on their knees and began to pray, crying upon God to do something.Soon their hearts were at rest as they were
assured that something great was on .the way.<span class="GramE">As they arose from their knees that Sunday night,
souls belonging to their beloved town were finding Jesus Christ as their
Saviour, hundreds of miles away in </span></span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE"><span lang="EN-GB">Yarmouth</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="GramE"><span lang="EN-GB"> and </span></span><st1:place><span class="GramE"><span lang="EN-GB">Lowestoft</span></span></st1:place><span class="GramE"><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></span><span lang="EN-GB">Nearly sixty years later the sacredness of that moment dawned upon me as
I listened to the young lassie, now an old woman tell me the story.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">During that next
week letters and telegrams began to arrive at <span class="SpellE">Findochty</span>,
telling of the blessing flowing at </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Yarmouth</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB">.Some of the most unlikely characters were
being saved there.But things were
happening here at home.Women were
converted at the wash-tub, in the shops and in the mending lofts.By the next weekend there was a large
improvement in the attendance at the meeting house. When the folks returned from the fishing, the
difference was remarkable.Homes were
united in Christ, wayward families saved and set free.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The record states
that as the men walked from <span class="SpellE">Buckie</span> to <span class="SpellE">Findochty</span>, a distance of two or three miles, the songs of
their pilgrimage to heaven were sung all the way.One of the most <span class="SpellE">noteable</span>
features of the move of God in <span class="SpellE">Findochty</span> was that
nearly every afternoon of the winter of 1921-22 groups of newly saved souls
would leave the town and go into the neighbouring villages and preach the
Gospel of Christ with remarkable results.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The abiding fruit
of these few months are still evident, with another generation experiencing the
same Christ as Saviour today in "<span class="SpellE">Finichty</span>".</span></p>
