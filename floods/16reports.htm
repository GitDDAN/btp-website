<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-GB">THE STRATEGY OF GOD<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="SpellE"><b><span lang="EN-GB">WILLlAM</span></b></span><b><span lang="EN-GB"> LEED<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The
editor suggested that I tell something of the story of the North Scottish
Awakening 1921-23, and I do so hoping that our faith may be strengthened that
the "God Who lived at Pentecost is just the same today'" Why not a
world-wide revival in our time?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">My title
is borrowed from Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Brengle</span> and his
observations of God strateg­ically using human events to accomplish His
purposes for the salvation of mankind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Surely
Divine strategy arranged <b>three
independent spiritual spearheads</b> to simultan­eously attack </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">East Anglia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span lang="EN-GB"> in 1921 with wide­ reaching results.
Rev. Douglas Brown was mightily used of God in Lowestoft and surrounding area;
in Yarmouth, Jock Troup, Scottish evangelist, then a Salvationist, was
conducting spare-time warfare on theatre and cinema queues, also pub
closing-time crowds, winning many souls; while Staff-captain Albert Osborn and
Staff­ captain Gordon Simpson S.F.T. at Clapton, were undoubtedly divinely
directed' to arrange a Charabanc Crusade comprising Training Officers and
Sergeants (I was fortunate to be a member) in widely scattered East Anglia,
which brought to Christ a multitude of souls - 106 in Norwich alone. Towns and
villages were invaded by <span class="SpellE">Crusadets</span>, morning, </span><st1:time hour="12" minute="0"><span lang="EN-GB">noon</span></st1:time><span lang="EN-GB"> and nights, with outstanding
response.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">I believe
God's strategy with those events was aimed at far wider issues, for the annual
invasion of the fishing ports by thous­ands of Scottish <span class="SpellE">fishworkers</span>
happened when Revival was getting into its stride. Douglas Brown had prolonged
his Campaign, all places of worship being thronged with seeking souls, great
numbers of Scots among them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The
fishing season ended, the Scots carried the Revival Fire north and North
Scottish towns and villages were aflame, converts "went everywhere
preaching the Lord Jesus", thousands being saved. At Peterhead 600 seekers
were registered, and Wick Corps saw at least 500, and great numbers of
professing Christians were revived; practically all denominations pulsated with
new life, and eager converts carried the Gospel to their neighbouring villages.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-GB">At Cullen,</span></b><span lang="EN-GB"> outpost of <span class="SpellE">Findochty</span>,
Lieutenant Reg. Woods (late Commissioner), led some little girls to Jesus and
told them to ask their mothers to pray for them. Golden haired Anna Gardiner
did so, and her war-widowed mother, stricken to the heart, replied, "My <span class="SpellE">quinie</span> (wee girl) I <span class="SpellE">canna</span>' pray
for <span class="SpellE">masel</span>' yet'" Said Anna, "<span class="SpellE">Mither</span>, ye can be saved. <span class="GramE">too</span>!"
That was a troubled night for Mrs. Gardiner, and it was no co-incidence led
Lieutenant Woods to bring a group of converts for an open-air next day almost
outside her door. Mrs. Gardiner left her washtub, arms full of soap-suds, and
standing in the ring with uplifted hands cried, "I want you all to know I
accept Jesus Christ as my Saviour!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Her
witness electrified Cullen <span class="SpellE">Seatown</span>; the Lieutenant
announced a meeting in the hall which was filled, and that afternoon a soul ­saving
work began that never ceased until very many converts were won.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A few
months later my Lieutenant (Col. Albert Towns) and I were appointed from
Clapton to. Cullen. These wonderful days - crowded meetings in the hall which
was filled, and that meetings weekdays and Sunday - 24 meetings weekly outdoors
and inside including Y.P. - great enthusiasm - everyone anxious to<i> </i>pray,
sing and testify. Our first open-air comprised eighty in the ring, and I felt
"surely God is in this place!" That was the night of our arrival and
that impression never left me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">To
organise the Corps was a glad responsibility, but we were anxious to win souls,
but this was difficult - everyone seemed already saved. The D.C. reminded us
there <span class="GramE">was</span> a time for ingathering and a time for
building them up in our most holy faith.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-GB">1922 was a wonderful year.</span></b><span lang="EN-GB">To<i> </i>watch these newly-born Christ­ians grow in grace and in the
knowledge of Christ was an inspirat­ion.It
did much for <span class="GramE">ourselves</span> also. A Training Officer had<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="GramE"><span lang="EN-GB">advised</span></span><span lang="EN-GB"> me
to give my very best in my first address and to improve on that standard in
every meeting following. He little realised what he was laying upon me. We had
eleven senior meetings weekly besides five Y.P. meetings and ten open-airs,
besides constant visitation.We had to
wrestle in prayer.Certain sects
challenged the converts on Army doctrine, which made us search the Scriptures
even more thoroughly than when in training, but this confirmed our confidence
in the Scriptural foundations of our movement. After a lifetime of prayerful
consideration of "the faith which was once delivered to<i> </i>the
saints", my convictions thereon are deeper than ever.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Somehow,
despite seeming improbability of another great ingather­ing of souls, we
believed we would again see God's hand mightily at work. For our New Year motto
we chose General Osborn's song "Greater Things", and in our <span class="SpellE">Watchnight</span> Service issued a challenge. After much prayer we
asked all who believed the coming year would show "even greater
things" to<i> </i>sing the chorus with uplifted hands. I see them now -
the packed hal1 - uplifted faces, same tear-stained - hands outstretched to<i> </i>God
- a sublime moment of childlike faith in God. We little realised how it should
come - another Great Awakening.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="SpellE"><b><span lang="EN-GB">Portsoy</span></b></span><b><span lang="EN-GB">,</span></b><span lang="EN-GB"> one-time
busy little sea part, six miles east of<i> </i>Cullen, was our responsibility.
We more than once held a two-man open-air there, but there seemed little
interest. We were later told the folk prided themselves that in former times
when revival swept the coast <span class="SpellE">Portsoy</span> remained
untouched. Duncan <span class="SpellE">Mathiesan</span> and James Turner were
reputed to<i> </i>have laboured there in vain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Delivering
SD envelopes there early in 1923 I was twice chall­enged;a woman told me <span class="SpellE">Portsoy</span>
could go to hel1 for all the Christians cared, and an elderly fisherman
implored me to hold meetings there. Deeply concerned, while cycling home that
day, I felt a distinct urge that something must be done. <span class="GramE">But
how?</span> Our Cul1en itinerary was heavy. Owing to a clause in letting of the
hall, we dared not close it for one night. Others were keen to use it, and once
they got in we would be on the streets.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">On the
following Tuesday, however, we arranged for someone to hold the fort at <span class="SpellE">Cullin</span> whilst a party of us invaded <span class="SpellE">Portsoy</span>
where a hall was engagedfor a
meeting.At the preceding open-air a
young man knelt in the ring causing a sensation. The hall was crowded. There
was obvious conviction, but none came forward indoors.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Next
Sunday a young <span class="SpellE">Portsoy</span> man came to Cullen and claimed
Salvation. Begging me to come to <span class="SpellE">Portsoy</span> for a Sunday
meeting, he said many there were under conviction and he was sure they would
respond. Again local difficulties confronted us, but I asked the Lord if this
was of Him would He cause the Lieutenant to offer to go with a. party. To my
joy, walking home that night the Lieutenant said, "Let me go with some of
the fellows, Captain." I immediately secured the hall and announced the
meeting. Next Sunday we turned our Cullen services into prayer meetings for <span class="SpellE">Portsoy</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">During
one night meeting I was distinctly convinced souls were surrendering at <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Portsoy</span></span><span class="GramE"> .</span>
Later I met the Lieutenant on the road home and said, "Before you tell me
anything, you have had souls."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"Yes,"
he replied, "three young men came forwards in the open-air, and six more
men indoors."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"Thank
God," I answered. "Now you will return tomorrow and others will
follow." One of the <span class="GramE">party</span> said later, "You
often speak about the Holy Spirit, Captain. I saw Him at work in the Lieutenant
in that open-air. He was truly filled with the Holy Ghost!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Next day
six young men surrendered. God now wonderfully helped with arrangements for our
Cullen meetings, and we had nine­teen seekers at <span class="SpellE">Portsoy</span>
on Tuesday. On Wednesday the D.C. came. We engaged the Town Hall and twenty-six
souls were registered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">And so it
went on; the Town Hall was packed nightly, floor and gallery, many unable to
gain admittance. Often folks were at the penitent-form before the meeting
commenced as the people gathered long before commencing time, singing and
praising God.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">There
were so few to help us with the penitents, we frequently had to leave the
prayer meeting to run itself. Eighty year old <span class="SpellE">grannie</span>
Pirie, olden-times Salvationist kept things <span class="SpellE">goin</span>. I
see her now walking the aisle singing, "There are angels hovering round ­to
carry the tidings home."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The town
seemed transformed; one somehow felt spiritual atmos­phere everywhere; the
glory of the Lord seemed upon the place. Singing could be heard from the houses
as converts gathered to praise God everywhere. I recall a wonderful occasion when
an elderly lady pulled me from the street into her home, saying, "Pray <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">wi</span></span>' me, Captain; I want tae <span class="SpellE">mak</span>' ma peace <span class="SpellE">wi</span>' God!" her
kitchen table became a hallowed altar. Many were pointed to Christ in their
homes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">One
memorable night when a hefty R.C. lady came to the Mercy­ seat a young woman
rushed forward embracing her. Enquiring later, I found the girl was her niece.
There was bitter estrangement between the families - family dispute - violence
- the lady had broken her brother's arm. For twenty years they had not spoken
to one another. Two years later I saw both families walking to the Holiness
Meeting with Bibles under their arms. "What a wonderful change in their
lives had been wrought since Jesus came into their hearts."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The
elderly fisherman and his <span class="GramE">wife</span> who first challenged
me, were converted and their home became the first Corps quarters. The lady
challenger of that day also came to the Lord. Later she became the Home League
Secretary. Her husband was a wonderful trophy of grace. Sixteen years afterwards
he thumped me on the back when I briefly visited the town, saying,
"Captain <span class="SpellE">Leed</span> you are my spirit­ual
father!" I was deeply moved as I also was that day on visiting a grand
soul who at conversion was unable to read owing to unfortunate circumstances in
childhood. She learned to read in order to understand the Bible and Song
Book.Greeting me with her Song Book in
her hand she joyfully said, "Oh Captain, listen tae this lovely <span class="SpellE">sonie</span> I've <span class="SpellE">jist</span> been <span class="SpellE">readin</span><span class="GramE">As</span> she read a thrill of joy came over me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">There was
no great preaching, just a simple presentation of the Gospel with earnest
appeals to yield to Christ. Sometimes no address was given, seekers came to the
penitent form as soon as the meetings commenced. An outstanding feature was
that the large proportion of elderly folk who were saved - aged married couples
particularly, and faithful Christians they became. There was no undue excite­ment,
they not being an over-emotional type. Prior to the Awakening it seemed a
spiritually indifferent town. .<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Lack of
space prevents further reminiscences but many times I have thanked God for the
gracious privilege of sharing in that wonderful work of grace, for a lifetime
friendship with my Lieutenant of those great <span class="GramE">days,</span> and
the memories of those converts the majority of whom are now in the <span class="SpellE">Gloryland</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"And
the hand of the Lord was with them and a great number believed and turned unto
the Lord." (Acts 11:21)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
