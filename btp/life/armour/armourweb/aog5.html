His sister was younger than him and did not appear to have the deep rooted problems that he had.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">We</span> always used to pray as a family, and we would ask the Lord to keep us safe before we drove anywhere.<span> So whenever we got into the car to leave home, they expected us to pray together.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">One</span> day the social worker came to our home to get them because they were going to visit their parents.<span> We watched as they got into the social workers car and drove away from the house. The car had not gone far when it stopped for one or two minutes before driving off again. I knew exactly what had happened. They would have said we havent prayed, we havent prayed.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The social worker had a degree in religious studies, but he did not have a belief in God.<span> His concern was for the children. He appreciated the benefit of prayer to them because it gave them a feeling of security. For this reason the social worker was willing to stop the car and I presume some kind of a prayer was made in the car.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Although</span> the social worker was willing to pray, truth was not important, what was important was the benefit the children received from feeling secure through prayer.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Quote:</b><span> General William Booth, the founder of the Salvation Army at the end of the nineteenth century said:</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">I am of the opinion that the greatest danger facing the twentieth century to be:</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Religion without the Holy Spirit;</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Christianity without Christ;</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Forgiveness without regeneration;</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Morality without God and</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Heaven without Hell.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>When the benefits of religion are regarded as more important than truth.</b><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Then religion used to meet people<span class="italic text-gray-600">'s needs</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The scriptures are not regarded as relevant</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Only concern</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Does religion help people?</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">If it can give a sense of comfort then its held to be good</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Question</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">What about truth?</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Not regarded as relevant.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Main Points:</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>1.<span> The Belt of Truth is Foundational.</span></b> <b>(</b>1 Peter 5:9)<span> Whom resist stedfast</span> in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Stedfast</b><b> in the Faith<span> (1 Peter 5:8-10)</span></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Watch -<span> The devil seeks to devour</span></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">1 Peter 5:8 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Resist Stedfast in the Faith (we face the same conflicts)</span></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">1 Peter 5:9<span> Whom resist stedfast</span> in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>The Belt of Truth in which we stand.</b><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">It is the Faith that we must earnestly contend for.Jude 3, Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Question:</b>What is the faith?</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">It is the Gospel message that Christ died for our sins, was buried and rose again.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">(1 Corinthians 15:<span>1-4)<span> "</span>Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also you have received, and wherein you stand; By which also you are saved, if you keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless you have believed in vain.
