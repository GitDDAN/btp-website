Why was this important?</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Because He came to make us like Himself.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">If Jesus did anything through His power as the Son of God He could not have said <span class="italic text-gray-600">"Greater works shall you do because I go to the Father"</span> (John 14:12).</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">There is only One eternal Son of God.

(Luke 2:52).</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Stature refers to growing physically, growing to maturity.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Favour refers to giving pleasure, delight.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The people of Nazareth enjoyed Jesus, the son of Mary, being in Nazareth.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">He was holy.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">He was godly.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">He was caring.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">He was a carpenter (probably the family provider after Joseph's death).</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">His custom was to read at the synagogue.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">He was in favour with the people.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Their attitude towards Him changed when He came in the power of the Holy Spirit.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>2.</strong> The ministry of Jesus was in the power of the Holy Spirit.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>a)</strong> The Holy Spirit descended upon Jesus when He was baptised by John the Baptist.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The ministry of Jesus began after He was baptised with the Holy Spirit.<span> Matthew 3:<span>16-17 <span class="italic text-gray-600">"And Jesus, when he was baptised, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>b)</strong> Immediately He was led of the Holy Spirit to be tempted.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Matthew 4:<span>1 "</span>Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.<span class="italic text-gray-600">"</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">He was tempted to move in His inherent power as the Son of God instead of moving under the leadership and in the power of the Holy Spirit.<span> "</span>If you are the Son of God<span class="italic text-gray-600">" Matthew 4:3,6.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">This would not only be a rejection of the Father's plan and purpose and the Holy Spirit<span class="italic text-gray-600">'s leadership, it would be a rejection of His people because He would be acting only for Himself.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">It was the same when He was on the cross.<span> Matthew 27:40 "</span>And saying, You that destroys the temple, and builds it in three days, save thyself. If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>c)</strong> Jesus came out of the wilderness in the power of the Holy Spirit.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Luke 4:<span>14 "</span>And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about.<span class="italic text-gray-600">"</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>3.</strong> The anointing brought persecution.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>a)</strong> Jesus was rejected when He returned to Nazareth in the power of the Holy Spirit.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The people who had seen Him every week were not willing to accept His ministry.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">They sought to kill Him when He told them He was the anointed One.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Jesus read from Isaiah 61:1-2a.<span> Jesus was declaring that He is the Anointed One, the Christ.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The Christ - His ministry</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Son of the Living God - His eternal nature and character</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>b)</strong> When Jesus read in the synagogue He did not read the whole passage, Luke 4:17-19.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">He closed the book and did not read <span class="italic text-gray-600">"the day of vengeance of our God"</span> Isaiah 61:2b.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">He did not come the first time to bring in the day of vengeance.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">They were so angry they wanted to kill Him because He was claiming to be the Messiah.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Luke 4:29-30<span> <span class="italic text-gray-600">"And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong. But he passing through the midst of them went his way,"</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Summary:</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>1)</strong> Jesus became like us so that we can become like Him.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>2)</strong> His ministry began when He was baptised with the Holy Spirit.<span> This is why He could say to His disciples <span class="italic text-gray-600">"<span>as my Father has sent me, even so send I you"</span> (John 20:21b).</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>3)</span>The anointing of the Spirit brought Him into conflict with those with whom He had favour before He was anointed with the Spirit.<span> The power of the Holy Spirit will bring the body of Christ into greater spiritual warfare.</span></p>
