<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The 1921 summer
herring fishing was not very successful so eyes and minds were turned towards
the season in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">East

sea.Soon places like Smith's Knoll
Bank, <span class="SpellE">Haisboro</span>' Lightship, Lemon Buoy and the <span class="SpellE">Scrobie</span> would be seen. These names were everyday language
to the seasoned fishermen. Young men were journeying south for the first time
and looked forward to the bright lights, for some, their first taste of worldly
pleasure. Little did they know that a material disaster lay ahead, yet it was
to be a time that would go down in the annals of eternity as a great harvest of
precious <span class="GramE">souls.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

trains were run from </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Scotland</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span lang="EN-GB"> to take those concerned south for the season. What many did not
realise was that their eternal destiny would be changed through God's
intervention. Sailing from most of the towns that the women had left, the
skippers would set their courses south. Although very interested in material
prospects, the Christians also looked forward to times of fellowship in the
Gospel. Many of these men would not ha' met since last year.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It was a season of
gales and herring were scarce. Many boats failed to meet their expenses. Some
braved the storms and had their nets torn.Others lay at their nets for days, waiting until the weather improved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">At this time the
Rev. A. Douglas Brown was conducting meetings around </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">East Anglia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span lang="EN-GB"> and was seeing God's blessing in a great measure. The <span class="SpellE">fisherfolk</span> from </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Scotland</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span lang="EN-GB">
were coming to a situation which smouldered with the prospects of a spiritual
awakening.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">How wonderful is
Gods clock, it is neither fast nor slow. Just as the Spirit of God fell upon
the company gathered on the day of Pentecost, so God chose to move in salvation
blessing when men and women came from many parts of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Scotland</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span lang="EN-GB">.God's timing was so accurate. Some of the
first hand stories I have heard are really tremendous. The main instrument in
the hands of God was the Wick cooper, Jock Troup. He may have been limited in
his academic education, but he <span class="GramE">learned ,</span> be willing
and obedient in God' s school.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Old friends met
together at weekends. The majority sought worldly entertainment. Gods children
met together in fellowship and drank at the wellsprings of grace.In </span><st1:street><st1:address><span lang="EN-GB">Fish Street</span></st1:address></st1:street><span lang="EN-GB">, to
the rear of the Market Place, the Brethren met in their hall. The Baptists
worshipped in their church behind </span><st1:street><st1:address><span lang="EN-GB">Regent Road</span></st1:address></st1:street><span lang="EN-GB">.

Hall.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">With a burning
passion for souls and a life filled with the Holy Spirit, Jock Troup accompanied
by a few friends, started to have open-air meetings at the Plain Stone (Market
Place), when the stalls had closed around </span><st1:time hour="21" minute="0"><span lang="EN-GB">9 p.m.</span></st1:time><span lang="EN-GB"> on a Saturday night. It
was on the third Saturday of October 1921 that God chose to move in power. Many
were thrown to. <span class="GramE">the</span> ground under conviction of sin
through the preaching of the Gospel of Christ As Jock preached from the first
verse of Isaiah chapter 63, "Who is this that cometh from </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Edom</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span lang="EN-GB">,
with dyed garments from <span class="SpellE">Bozrah</span>? <span class="GramE">this</span>
that is glorious in His apparel, travelling in the greatness of His strength? <span class="GramE">I that speak in righteousness mighty to save."</span> A young
fisherman from <span class="SpellE">Cairnbulg</span> went into the open air ring
and started to sing, <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">''It's altered
now, <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It's altered now, <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The devil once had
me, <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">But Jesus ransomed
me, <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It's altered
now." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">When the Holy
Spirit took control, scores of hardened fishermen and <span class="SpellE">fisherlassies</span>
were gripped with the fear of God. They knelt at the Yarmouth Cross and their
burdens were lifted because of </span><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Calvary</span></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">. On account of that event, many lives and communities would never
be the same again. As I listened to men and women who were there on that night
I realised how great was the power of God that was manifested there. One man
talked to told me he was literally "Slain of the Lord" and fell to the
ground. He said, "The ground around me was like a battlefield with souls
crying to God for mercy." My own faith was there, but he was not saved
until the next week when he was aboard a herring drifter, sea, eight miles from
the <span class="SpellE">Haisboro</span>' Lightship.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">We may question
such happenings, but similar events occurred when Jonathan Edwards preached in </span><st1:state><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Massachusetts</span></st1:place></st1:state><span lang="EN-GB">. On
that occasion men and women hung on to the pillars of the church under
conviction of sin. We must realise that when God moves, spectacular things happen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Services were also
held in the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span lang="EN-GB">Deneside</span></span></st1:placename><st1:placename><span lang="EN-GB">Methodist</span></st1:placename><st1:placetype><span lang="EN-GB">Church</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB"> and in </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span lang="EN-GB">St. George's</span></st1:placename><st1:placetype><span lang="EN-GB">Church</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">. What
meetings they were! <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">lt</span></span> is
reported that they went on for hours. One particular night stands out.Jock Troup and Douglas Brown stood in the
pulpit of the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span lang="EN-GB">Deneside</span></span></st1:placename><st1:placename><span lang="EN-GB">Methodist</span></st1:placename><st1:placetype><span lang="EN-GB">Church</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB"> with
their arm around one another, weeping as they basked in the Divine Presence of
God. The refined Baptist minister and the rough herring cooper were united and
they became life-long friends. The Market Place and the Post Office were still
the prime places for open air witness. One man who came from Port Gordon, named
Alex <span class="SpellE">Thain</span>, told me that he was strolling past the
Market Place on a Saturday night with five of his friends when some unseen
power made them pay attention to the singing. Suddenly he was left standing
alone, his friends had responded to the call to follow Christ. It was a few
years later until Alex was converted.At
that open-air meeting, unknown to him, was the woman who was to become his
wife, Agnes <span class="SpellE">Cowe</span>. As the crowd sang that lovely hymn
from the <span class="SpellE">Sankey</span> Hymn book, number 466, she answered
the call, took the step and has lived for Christ all her life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">On the Monday
morning work carried on as usual. Jock returned to his coopering, his friends
to their fishing, but by no means was the blessing of God confined to meetings.
On the <span class="SpellE">Denes</span> where most of the curing yards were and
across the river at <span class="SpellE">Gorleston</span> in the yards there, the
songs of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Zion</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> were sung. Far out at sea as the boats lay at their nets, the
singing of men who were redeemed wafted over the waves. Whenever work was
finished, meetings were held. Often due to bad weather the boats would tie up
and many would gather together at all hours in different places. Meetings would
often go on until </span><st1:time hour="3" minute="0"><span lang="EN-GB">three
 o'clock</span></st1:time><span lang="EN-GB"> in the morning. Souls were often
saved in the houses where the <span class="SpellE">fisherlassies</span> lodged.
In the curing yards amidst the herring, salt, pickle and barrels there were
those who came into the experience of salvation and had their souls preserved
for eternity. It was common for the foreman of the curing yard to get Jock to
lead his workers to Christ at all hours of the day to they could all go back to
their work. The story is told that one Monday morning, (that was the day the
curers would fill up the barrels which had been packed with herring previously,
because the salt had melted and the fish had sunk in the barrel) that three
"<span class="SpellE">Heiland</span> <span class="SpellE">Quines</span>",
(lassies from the Isle of Lewis) failed to turn up for work and their employer
went to see what was wrong. When he found them in their lodgings under deep
conviction of sin, he went straight for Jock Troup who led them to Christ. They
rejoiced in this great salvation and returned to their work among the herring.
Conviction was <span class="GramE">everywhere,</span> hearts were broken as souls
wept over their sins.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Men were getting
saved at sea aboard the herring boats. As they steamed to the fishing grounds by
the Knoll Lightship and the <span class="SpellE">Haisboro</span> Lightship,
unsaved crewmen would be led to Christ by new converts. The nets were laid in
the sea and as the drifters lay with their heads into the wind, big rough
fishermen, who until now knew no fear, cried out in terror of being lost in
hell.Engineers in the bowels of the
ships looking after the coal-fired boilers were reminded of the fire of hell
and the lost eternity which awaits the ungodly. They cried to God for help and
found refuge in Christ. During hauling operations which took at least four
hours and even sometime up to ten hours when pulling eighty nets, there were
tremendous times of blessing. Many were saved as the nets were being hauled
aboard.The soul concerned would just
let the net go, fall on his knees and cry for salvation. What days!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Telegrams brought
home news of the spiritual awakening to the ports of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Scotland</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span lang="EN-GB">.
Letters told of who and where their salvation took place. A telegram from a
certain Bobby Ritchie read "Saved, 10 miles from Knoll -Lightship, last to
ring in on this ship." All the interest was in souls, no wonder a mighty
harvest was reaped for God.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">During the time
when <span class="GramE">a </span></span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE"><span lang="EN-GB">Yarmouth</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB">
fishing was at its height, it was interesting to walk along the quay, starting
at the Trawl Market, past the Herring Market and continue right down past all
the "posts" until you came to the <span class="SpellE">Freshing</span>

the events at </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Yarmouth</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> could be placed on a parallel with those in the second chapter of
the Acts of the Apostles. God moved on the Day of Pentecost when people were
gathered from many places and they went home with a glorious experience in
their lives to be witnesses to the living Christ. Peter and John spoke the word
with boldness. Signs and wonders followed the preaching of the gospel in Acts
chapters 3 and 4.Further on, in Acts
chapter 8, we find Philip the evangelist planting the church </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Samaria</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> and seeing
a great spiritual awakening.Then
suddenly he is called away south to </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Gaza</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> to meet the
Ethiopian eunuch who confesses Christ as Lord. Philip may have had every reason

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Jock Troup, while
in the midst of a <span class="SpellE">spirital</span> revival, heard God speak,
and had a vision.What he saw was a man
praying far north in <span class="SpellE">Fraserburgh</span>. This man was asking
the Lord to send the evangelist He was using in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Yarmouth</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> north to
where there was a great need. This man had never seen Jock, but he had heard
what was happening among the fishermen. By this time the cooper-evangelist had
been dismissed from his work because of the call on his time.He had never been to <span class="SpellE">Fraserburgh</span>,
but he had no intention of being disobedient to the heavenly vision. Jock told
some of his closest friends of what he had seen and of his decision to
leave.They could not understand why he
was going when such mighty blessing was taking place. He knew that the God Who
had started the work in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Yarmouth</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB">, would continue it. Many tried to persuade the revivalist to stay,
but nothing and no one would prevent him from answering the call of the Master.
The next day the evangelist left.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">As the season drew
to a close, fishermen prepared for the voyage to their home ports. Nets were
made up into individual bundles, spare and damaged nets were taken aboard from
the place of storage. With the anticipation of reunion, courses were set for
the North. Through the Cockle Gate, past, the <span class="SpellE">Haisboro</span>'
Lightship, past the Long stones where Grace Darling became a heroine, the
drifters would steam. As the armada sailed north the numbers would decrease
rapidly. <span class="GramE">Once Peterhead was passed, those sailing for Wick
