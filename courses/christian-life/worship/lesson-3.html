T<span>his is the first step in becoming a worshipper.</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"&gt; The Samaritan woman was excited about meeting Jesus.<span> Her</span>excitement is seen as she went into the city leaving her waterpot at the well and then calling to the people <span>(John</span><st1:time hour="4" minute="29">4:29</st1:time>).<span> Her heart longed for the Lord even though she did not know Him. <span>She was not yet a worshipper, but she was being drawn to the Lord and this is the first stage in worship (Song of Solomon 1:4).</span></span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>&gt; The depths that we have been lifted from should reflect the height of our worship.<span> <span>The First Epistle of Peter says it this way, that we who belong to the Lord were outcasts, like the Samaritan woman, but now we have been called to worship:</span> <span class="italic text-gray-600">"But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that you should show forth the praises of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:<span> Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy."</span> (1 Peter 2:9-10).</span> Those looked upon as the lowest in society can reach the greatest heights in worship.</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"&gt; The depth of our relationship with the Lord will be determined by how much we desire to know Christ.<span> The highest calling of the Psalmist David was to worship. This was a higher calling than his call to be King (Psalms 27:4).</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Charles Spurgeon said If God calls you to be a preacher, do not stoop to be a King, but the greatest call is not the call to be a preacher it is the call to worship.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Summary: </b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The call to worship is the highest calling of God.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>1.</strong> The Father is still seeking worshippers.<span> The worshipper never loses the excitement of knowing Jesus, and the prayer of his or her heart will always be <span class="italic text-gray-600">"that I might know Him"</span>.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>2.</strong> The Lord was drawing the woman to Himself, and it was the Holy Spirit who opened her heart through a word of knowledge.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>3.</strong> The Lord is no respecter of persons.<span> The Samaritan woman is an example of the lowest in society being called to the highest calling to worship.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>What should the students do?</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>1)</strong> Knowing the depths that we have been lifted from should make us reach for the heights of worship.<span> A worshipper will seek to glorify the Lord at all times.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>2)</strong> Recognise that it is the Lord who is drawing us to worship and develop a love relationship with Him.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>3)</strong> Understand that God is no respecter of persons and there are no social barriers in being a worshipper.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>4)</strong> Keep our hearts pure so that we have one desire to know the Lord as a worshipper.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><a href="lesson-2.html"><span>Lesson Outline</span></a></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b><a href="/courses/christian-life/worship/part-1.html">Course Index</a></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><a href="/courses/christian-life/worship.html"><span>Textbook</span></a> <span>- The Higher Calling to Worship</span></p>
