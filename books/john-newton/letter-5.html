<p>LETTER V.</p>
<p>DEAR SIR,</p>
<p><strong><em></em></strong></p>
<p>The two following years, of which I am now to
give some account, will seem as an absolute blank in a very short life; but as
the Lord's hour of grace was not yet come, and I was to have still deeper
experience of the dreadful state of the heart of man, when left to itself, I
have seen frequent cause since to admire the mercy of the Lord, in banishing me
to those distant parts, and almost excluding me from human society, at a time
when I was big with mischief, and, like one infected with a pestilence, was
capable of spreading a taint wherever I went.<strong><em></em></strong></p>
<p>Had my affairs taken a different turn, had I
succeeded in my designs, and remained in England, my sad story would probably have
been worse. Worse in myself, indeed, I could have hardly been; but my
wickedness would have had greater scope. I might have been very hurtful to
others, and multiplied irreparable evils. But the Lord wisely placed me where I
could do little harm. The few I had to
converse with were too much like myself, and I was soon brought into such
abject circumstances, that I was too low to have any influence. I was rather
shunned and despised than imitated; there being few, even of the negroes
themselves (during the first year of my residence among them), but thought
themselves too good to speak to me. I was to all appearance exposed to perish.
But the Lord beheld me with mercy. He did not strike me to hell, as I justly
deserved; He passed by me when I was in my blood, and .bid me live. (Ezek. xvi.
6.) I can only ascribe it to His secret upholding power, that what I suffered
in a part of this interval did not bereave me either of my life or senses; yet,
as by these sufferings the force of my evil examples and inclinations was
lessened, I have reason to account them amongst my mercies.</p>
<p><strong><em>Geographical sketch of the circuit</em></strong></p>
<p>It may not perhaps be amiss to digress for a
few lines, and give you a very brief sketch of the geography of the circuit I
was now confined to, especially as I may have frequent occasion to refer to
places I shall now mention; for my trade afterwards, when the Lord gave me to
see better days, was chiefly to the same places, and with the same persons,
where and .by whom I had been considered as upon a level with their meanest
slaves. </p>
<p>From Cape de Verd, the most western point of Africa, to Cape Mount, the whole coast is full of rivers.
The principal are Gambia, Rio Grande, Sierra Leone, and Sherbro. Of the former, as it
is well known, and I was never there, I need say nothing. The Rio Grande (like the Nile) divides into many branches near
the sea. On the most northerly, called Cacheo, the Portuguese have a
settlement. The most southern branch, known by the name of Rio Nuna, is, or
then was, the usual boundary of the white men's trade northward. Sierra Leone is a mountainous peninsula,
uninhabited, and, I believe, inaccessible, upon account of the thick woods,
excepting those parts which lie near the water. The river is large and navigable.
From hence, about twelve leagues to the south-east, are three contiguous
islands, called the Benanoes, about twenty miles in circuit. This was about the
centre of the white men's residence.
Seven leagues farther, the same way, lie the Plantanes, three small
islands, two miles distant from the continent at the point, which form one side
of the Sherbro. This river is more properly a sound, running within a long
island, and receiving the confluence of several large rivers, unknown to song,
but far more deeply engraven in my remembrance than the Po or Tiber. The southernmost of these has a
very peculiar course, almost parallel to the coast; so that in tracing it a
great many leagues upwards, it will seldom lead one above three miles, and
sometimes not more than half a mile from the seashore. Indeed, I know not, but
that all these rivers may have communications with each other, and with the
sea, in many places which I have not remarked:
If you cast your eyes upon a large map of Africa, while you are reading
this, you will have a general idea of the country I was in; for though the maps
are very incorrect, most of the places I have mentioned are inserted, and in
the same order as I have named them. </p>
<p><strong><em>Facing mistreatment from his Masters black
mistress at the Plantanes</em></strong></p>
<p>My new master had formerly resided near Cape Mount, but he now settled at the
Plantanes, upon the largest of the three islands. It is a low, sandy island,
about two miles in circumference, and almost covered with palm trees. We
immediately began to build a house, and to enter upon trade. I had now some
desire to retrieve my lost time, and to exert diligence in what was before me;
and he was a man with whom I might have lived tolerably well, if he had not
been soon influenced against me; but he was much under the direction of a black
woman, who lived with him as a wife. She was a person of some consequence in
her own country, and he owed his first rise to her interest. This woman (I know
not for what reason) was strangely prejudiced against me from the first; and
what made it still worse for me, was a severe fit of illness which attacked me
very soon, before I had opportunity to show what I could or would do in his
service. I was sick when he sailed in a
shallop to Rio Nuna, and he left me in her hands. At first I was taken some
care of; but as I did not recover very soon she grew weary, and entirely
neglected me. I had sometimes not a little difficulty to procure a draught of
cold water, when burning with a fever. My bed was a mat, spread upon a board or
chest, and a log of wood my pillow. When
my fever left me, and my appetite returned, I would gladly have eaten, but no
one gave unto me. She lived in plenty herself, but hardly allowed me sufficient
to sustain life, except now and then, when in the highest good-humour, she
would send me victuals on her own plate after she had dined; and this (so
greatly was my pride humbled) I received with thanks and eagerness, as the most
needy beggar does alms. Once, I well
remember, I was called to receive this bounty from her own hand; but, being
exceedingly weak and feeble, I dropped the plate. Those who live in plenty can hardly conceive
how this loss touched me; but she had the cruelty to laugh at my disappointment;
and though the table was covered with dishes (for she lived much in the
European manner), she refused to give me any more. My distress has been at
times so great, as to compel me to go by night and pull up roots in the
plantation (though at the risk of being punished as a thief), which I have
eaten raw upon the spot, for fear of discovery. The roots I speak of are very
wholesome food, when boiled or roasted, but as unfit to be eaten raw in any
quantity as a potato. The consequence of this diet, which after the first
experiment I always expected, and seldom missed, was the same as if I had taken
tartar emetic; so that I have often returned as empty as I went; yet necessity
urged me to repeat the trial several times. I have sometimes been relieved by
strangers; nay, even by the slaves in the chain, who have secretly brought me
victuals (for they durst not be seen to do it) from their own slender pittance.
Next to pressing want, nothing sits harder upon the mind than scorn and
contempt and of this likewise I had an abundant measure. When I was very slowly
recovering, this woman would sometimes pay me a visit, not to pity or relieve,
but to insult me. She would call me worthless and indolent, and compel me to
walk, which, when I could hardly do, she would set her attendants to mimic my
motion, to clap their hands, laugh, throw limes at me; or, if they chose to
throw stones, (as I think was the case once or twice), they were not rebuked;
but in general, though all who depended on her favour must join in her
treatment, yet, when she was out of sight, I was rather pitied than scorned by
the meanest of her slaves.</p>
<p><strong><em>Leaves with Master</em></strong></p>
<p>At length my master returned from his voyage I
complained of ill-usage, but he could not believe me; and as I did it in her
hearing, I fared no better for it. But in his second voyage he took me with
him.</p>
<p><strong><em>Facing harsh treatment
from Master</em></strong></p>
<p>We did pretty well for a while, till a brother
trader he met in the river persuaded him that I was unfaithful, and stole his
goods in the night or when he was on shore. This was almost the only vice I
could not be justly charged with. The only remains of a good education I could
boast of, was what is commonly called honesty; and as far as he had entrusted
me, I had been always true; and though my great distress might in some measure,
have excused it, I never once thought of defrauding him in the smallest
matter. However, the charge was
believed, and I condemned without evidence.</p>
<p>From that time he likewise used me very hardly.
Whenever he left the vessel I was locked upon deck, with a pint of rice for my
day's allowance; and if he stayed longer, I had no relief till his return.
Indeed, I believe I should have been nearly starved but for an opportunity of
catching fish sometimes. When fowls were killed for his own use I seldom was
allowed any part but the entrails, to bait my hooks with; and, at what we call
slack water, that is, about the changing of the tides, when the current was
still, I used generally to fish (for at other times it was not practicable),
and I very often succeeded. If I saw a fish upon my hook, my joy was little
less than any other person may have found in the accomplishment of the scheme
he had most at heart. Such a fish,
hastily broiled, or rather half burnt; without sauce, salt, or bread, has
afforded me a delicious meal. If I caught none, I might, if I could, sleep away
my hunger till the next return of slack water, and then try again. Nor did I
suffer less from the inclemency of the weather, and the want of clothes. The
rainy season was now advancing: my whole suit was a shirt, a pair of trousers,
a cotton handkerchief instead of a cap, and a cotton cloth about two yards
long, to supply the want of upper garments; and thus accoutred, I have been
exposed for twenty, thirty, perhaps near forty hours together, in incessant
rains, accompanied with strong gales of wind, without the least shelter, when
my master was on shore. I feel to this day some faint returns of the violent
pains I then contracted. The excessive cold and wet I endured in that voyage,
and so soon after I had recovered from a long sickness, quite broke my
constitution and my spirits. The latter were soon restored, but the effects of
the former still remain with me, as a needful memento of the service and the
wages of sin.</p>
<p>In about two months we returned, and then the
rest of the time I remained with him was chiefly spent at the Plantanes, under
the same regimen as I have already mentioned. My haughty heart was now brought
down, not to a wholesome repentance, not to the language of the prodigal-this
was far from me; but my spirits were sunk; I lost all resolution, and almost
all reflection. I had lost the fierceness which fired me when on board the <i>Harwich,
</i>and which made me capable of the most desperate attempts; but I was no
further changed than a tiger, tamed by hunger: remove the occasion, and he will
be as wild as ever.</p>
<p>One thing, though strange, is most true. Though
destitute of food and clothing, depressed to a degree beyond common
wretchedness, I could sometimes collect my mind to mathematical studies. I had
bought Barrow's <i>Euclid</i><i> </i>at Plymouth; it was the only volume I brought
on shore; it was always with me, and I used to take it to remote corners of the
island by the sea-side, and draw my diagrams with a long stick upon the sand.
Thus I often beguiled my sorrows, and almost forgot my feeling-and thus,
without any other assistance, I made myself, in a good measure, master of the
first six books of Euclid.</p>
<p> I
am yours,</p>
<p> Dear
Sir, etc.</p>
