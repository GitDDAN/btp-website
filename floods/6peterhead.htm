<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Famous even then
for its prison which held in its security some of the worst criminals in the
land, the town had many of its inhabitants held captive by the Devil at his
will. Many a young fisherman had returned from the war godless and careless
regarding his soul's eternal welfare.Yet to many of these men who had seen front line action on land and sea,
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Yarmouth</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> 1921 would be a year when spiritual battles would be fought in
their souls.Scores of Peterhead
fishermen were saved and rejoiced in the experience of sins forgiven. Their
lives were changed when spiritual debt was cancelled at the place called </span><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Calvary</span></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">.In some cases whole crews of drifters were
converted, either through attending Douglas Brown's services in </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span lang="EN-GB">St. <span class="GramE">George' s</span></span></st1:placename><st1:placetype><span lang="EN-GB">Church</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB"> or at open-air meetings held by Jock Troup.Miraculous things took place among the
Peterhead fisher lassies as they were gutting the herring at the <span class="SpellE">Denes</span> on the sea-front.One herring curer told me it was a usual occurrence to see women crying for
peace with God among the herring barrels at the Peterhead owned curing
stations. The prayers of men like "Petrie <span class="SpellE">Shonie</span>"
<span class="SpellE">Strachan</span>, John Noble Stephen and many others were
being answered by a covenant-keeping God.I have personally heard the testimonies of men and women who were
redeemed at </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Yarmouth</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> nearly sixty years ago and they are still going on for God.When the Lord moved, He saved men and women
who established Christian homes, their children were led to Christ and they in
turn are bringing up the grandchildren in the same way.Peterhead was particularly favoured as far as
the salvation of souls was concerned.I
am convinced that this was because godly men and women prayed in earnest.Not only were there new converts, but many
who had professed salvation in former days were called to a fresh dedication in
their experience.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Yarmouth</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> that year
was a young man engaged as cook on the drifter Energy.David <span class="SpellE">Cordiner</span> had
been saved at the age of thirteen in Peterhead Baptist Church through an evangelist
named McGregor, but had grown cold in heart during the war years when he served
as a corporal of cooks. David attended meetings conducted by Douglas Brown and
Jock Troup where he was wonderfully blessed and empowered by the Holy Spirit.
While cooking a meal for his shipmates, he took his cigarettes and threw them
into the galley stove.He had made up
his mind to be on fire for God. As he slept one night on board his ship which
was moored on the river, God spoke to him clearly and told him that when he got
home to Peterhead he had to go to </span><st1:street><st1:address><span lang="EN-GB">Broad Street</span></st1:address></st1:street><span lang="EN-GB">
and conduct open-air meetings.David
told the Lord, as Jeremiah did in Bible days, that he could not speak, but the
Lord said, "Open your mouth and I will fill it". After this a hymn
came to his mind, <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"Must I go
and empty handed, must I meet my Saviour so?" <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">He cried out that
night, "I will go." Little did he realise that the vision he had
received from the Lord would take him into places and situations where mighty
things would be done through him.Here
is an example of what God can do with a life completely given over to Him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

never do that, you are far too quiet." It was </span><st1:time hour="0" minute="0"><span lang="EN-GB">midnight</span></st1:time><span lang="EN-GB"> on a
Friday when the boat arrived at Peterhead harbour. David could never have
imagined that God had decided that he was to be a fisher of men instead of a
fisherman.When he arrived home he told
his godly mother of the vision. She expressed her feelings that he would never
make a speaker. However, she said that she would pray for him, and he testified
that her prayers held him up when he went forth to preach at the <span class="SpellE">Broadgate</span> in Peterhead, where he saw many souls won for Christ.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

The next day being a Saturday, he did his work cleaning
out the cabin of the drifter Energy.He
met some of the young men who had professed salvation and told them what he was
going to do. They were asked to join him at </span><st1:time hour="19" minute="0"><span lang="EN-GB">7 p.m.</span></st1:time><span lang="EN-GB"> that
evening at the Monument in the middle of </span><st1:street><st1:address><span lang="EN-GB">Broad Street</span></st1:address></st1:street><span lang="EN-GB">.About the appointed time on the way down the
street, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Davie</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> met two Salvation Army lads and asked for their support. When they
arrived at the Monument they found a few people had gathered to see the man who
had received the vision. Amongst those standing <span class="GramE">were</span>
"Petrie <span class="SpellE">Shonie</span>" and Alex
"Skelton" Summers. The meeting commenced by singing the hymn, <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">'There is power in
the blood of the Lamb". <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Davie</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> had taken
twelve hymn sheets printed with well-known songs which he shared around. Little
did these men realise that although some of them had only been converted a few
days, they were on the brink of a tremendous move of the Spirit that was going
to have far reaching effects on the town of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Peterhead</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB">. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Crowds began to
gather around the small group. Very soon there was a congregation estimated at
about 200, all standing spellbound listening to the cook and his friends
telling of Christ's power to save.The
open-air was stir in progress at </span><st1:time hour="21" minute="0"><span lang="EN-GB">9 p.m.</span></st1:time><span lang="EN-GB"> After that someone said
that a part of the crowd had gone to the Salvation Army Hall in </span><st1:street><st1:address><span lang="EN-GB">Chapel Street</span></st1:address></st1:street><span lang="EN-GB">.
When </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Davie</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> and his friends got there the place was full. It is reported that
so many came forward in answer to the appeal that the penitent form was
overcrowded and extra room had to be made for the seekers.Peterhead Salvation Army did not delay in
supporting the work of God and were prepared to make <span class="GramE">themselves</span>
available at any time to deal with troubled souls. Their hall was opened during
the day for special times of prayer and praise, with gospel services being held
every evening.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Open-air meetings
were held nightly at the Monument in </span><st1:street><st1:address><span lang="EN-GB">Broad Street</span></st1:address></st1:street><span lang="EN-GB">,
followed by a march to wherever a special service was being held. Salvation was
now the order of the day, with souls getting saved in their homes as well as in
places of worship. Large crowds would listen to preaching in the open air. On
one occasion the </span><st1:street><st1:address><span lang="EN-GB">Broad Street</span></st1:address></st1:street><span lang="EN-GB"> stance was not available, so David <span class="SpellE">Cordiner</span>
decided to hold his meeting at the Drummer's Corner. It started at </span><st1:time hour="19" minute="0"><span lang="EN-GB">7 p.m.</span></st1:time><span lang="EN-GB">
and by </span><st1:street><st1:address><span lang="EN-GB">7.30 Albion Street</span></st1:address></st1:street><span lang="EN-GB"> and </span><st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE"><span lang="EN-GB">Marischal</span></span><span lang="EN-GB"> Street</span></st1:address></st1:street><span lang="EN-GB"> <span class="GramE">were</span> completely blocked by an eager
audience. So dense was the crowd that the Police were called to assist.</span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Davie</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> was told that he must confine his open-air meetings to </span><st1:street><st1:address><span lang="EN-GB">Broad Street</span></st1:address></st1:street><span lang="EN-GB">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">One rainy night
when the appeal was made, no one came forward to kneel in the centre of the
open-air ring. </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Davie</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> took off his coat and laid it on the ground. A woman came forward
and found Christ while kneeling on his coat. Others, including "Petrie <span class="SpellE">Shonie</span>", Bill's Robbie and Skelton's Alex followed his
example and put their coats on the street. At least ninety people were
converted that night beside the Monument.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">By now the
denominations of the town had begun to see that the work being done was not
superficial, but was a genuine move of the Holy Spirit. Consequently, doors and
hearts were opened to the young evangelist.The elders of the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span lang="EN-GB">Methodist</span></st1:placename><st1:placetype><span lang="EN-GB">Church</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB"> offered him the use of their building. Meetings held there became a
harvest of souls. The years of ploughing and sowing had paid off.A schoolmaster and a student teacher attended
one of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span lang="EN-GB">Davie</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="SpellE"><span lang="EN-GB">'s</span></span><span lang="EN-GB"> services. After
the meeting the student asked the teacher what he thought of the evangelist's
treatment of the King's English. The older man replied, "It does not
matter in the least if his English is not accurate, the important thing is that
he is getting results." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">On </span><st1:date day="27" month="11" year="1921"><span lang="EN-GB">November 27th, 1921</span></st1:date><span lang="EN-GB">, Mr. Alex Marshall returned to the Gospel Hall in </span><st1:street><st1:address><span lang="EN-GB">Prince Street</span></st1:address></st1:street><span lang="EN-GB">
to conduct a series of nightly meetings. Many were saved during these special
services. These converts have stood for Christ for many years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">On returning from </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Yarmouth</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB">, Alex
"<span class="SpellE">Soldie</span>" <span class="SpellE">Cowe</span>
told the minister of the Congregational Church, a Mr. <span class="SpellE">Hanmer</span>,
of the good work that had been done among the <span class="SpellE">fisherfolk</span>.
"<span class="SpellE">Soldie</span>" then asked him if he would
consider making an outward appeal for souls to come forward after the service
on Sunday evening. This was done and at least six made their way to the front
as an indication of their desire to get right with God.As far as is known, this was never tried
during the awakening in the Congregational Church.After this, the United Free Church along with
the Congregational Church arranged meetings to be conducted by a Mr. John
Moor.An evangelistic campaign was also
held in the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span lang="EN-GB">Baptist</span></st1:placename><st1:placetype><span lang="EN-GB">Church</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB"> by a Rev. Gilmour. These two special efforts saw blessing in a
measure, but little compared to that experienced with Davie <span class="SpellE">Cordiner</span>,
who was the leader, under God.One newspaper
report concerning Davie <span class="SpellE">Cordiner</span> stated, <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"The rugged
revivalist says, 'Before I went to </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Yarmouth</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> I could
not and would not speak in the Salvation Army meetings.Satan had me in his grip, but God did a work
in me at </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Yarmouth</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> one night and I rededicated me life to Christ and His
service." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The paper
continues, <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"He spends
his time visiting and telling others of Christ and His power to save, even at
the Labour Exchange, where many people gather daily. One of his qualities is
inspired praying." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The blessing of
God continued on through December and into the New Year. Then the Fishermen's </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Mission</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> opened in </span><st1:street><st1:address><span lang="EN-GB">Charlotte Street</span></st1:address></st1:street><span lang="EN-GB"> under the leadership of Captain Andrew <span class="SpellE">Cowe</span>.Many young converts were strengthened and a
goodly number professed salvation. One outstanding feature during the month of
December was the march of witness. These marches were led by someone playing a
musical instrument.Scores of new
converts followed on singing the well known gospel songs.This unique procession would start after an open-air
meeting in the <span class="SpellE">Broadgate</span>, move into </span><st1:street><st1:address><span lang="EN-GB">Chapel Street</span></st1:address></st1:street><span lang="EN-GB">,

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It was not all
encouragement for the leaders of the work.Many were critical, others discouraged new converts and some said that
it would not last, but those to whom God had entrusted the leadership of the
work pressed on.There is plenty of
evidence today, in 1981, that the work done in the hearts in December 1921 has
stood the test of time for sixty years.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It will be helpful
to take note of what the religious leaders of Peterhead in 1921 had to say
about the awakening.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The minister of
the <b>Old Parish Church</b>, the Rev. H.
D. Swan said, "I rejoice with all my heart and soul that there is a real
