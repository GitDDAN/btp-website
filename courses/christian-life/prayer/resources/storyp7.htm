<p><b><span lang="EN-GB">Finney on Revival<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">An
individual once went into a manufactory to see the machinery. His mind was
solemn, as he had been where there was a revival.The people who <span class="SpellE">labored</span>
there all knew him by sight, and knew who he was. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">A young
lady who was at work saw him, and whispered some foolish remark to her
companion, and laughed. The person stopped and looked at her with a feeling of grief.
She stopped; her thread broke - and she was so much agitated that she could not
join it. She looked out at the window to compose <span class="GramE">herself</span>,
and then tried again; again and again she strove to recover her self-command. At
length she sat down, overcome by her feelings. The person then approached and
spoke with her; she soon manifested a deep sense of sin. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The
feeling spread through the establishment like fire, and in a few hours almost
every person employed there was under conviction; so much so that the owner,
though a worldly man, was astounded, and requested to have the works stopped
and a prayer-meeting held; for he said it was a great deal more important to
have these people converted than to have the works go on. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">And in a
few days the owner and nearly all the persons employed in the establishment (about
3000) were hopefully converted. The eye of this individual, his solemn
countenance, his compassionate feeling, rebuked the levity of the young woman,
and brought her under conviction of sin; and probably in a great measure this
whole revival followed from so small an incident.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
