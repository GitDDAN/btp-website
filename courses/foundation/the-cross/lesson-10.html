(Romans 11:26)</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>When Jesus rode into</span><st1:city><st1:place>Jerusalem</st1:place></st1:city> on the Sunday before His crucifixion (Palm Sunday), John 12:12-19, He was treated by the people as a mighty deliverer because of the miracles that He had done (John <st1:time hour="12" minute="17">12:17</st1:time>-18).</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">But when He was taken to be crucified they rejected Him because a deliverer would be able to prevent himself being crucified..</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The fact that He did nothing to defend Himself seemed to show weakness not power.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Even when Jesus was being crucified the crowd called for Him to exercise His power by coming down from the cross.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Matthew 27:39-40, And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,<span> And saying, Thou that destroys the temple, and builds it in three days, save yourself. If you be the Son of God, come down from the cross.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The religious leaders mocked Him as a deliverer who could not save himself.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Matthew 27:41-43, Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said, He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.<span> He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>The cross was foolish to the Greeks because it goes against human reasoning:</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The cross was final.<span> No one came back a better person having been through the crucifixion experience. They were taken down as a corpse.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">No benefit could be achieved by the cross</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The message of the cross defies human reasoning.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The Christian message is the message of new life through the cross.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Introductory<span> Story:</span></b>The message of the cross is not the message of how to raise self esteem.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The message of the cross is the message of new life.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">For me the greatest possible place to preach the gospel is in prison.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">I have preached on many themes, but I only have one message.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">It is the message of new life in Christ.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">A person who receives Christ is a new creation the old is gone, crucified with Christ and new life in Christ begins.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Preachers who seek to raise peoples self esteem will be more popular than preachers who preach new life through the cross.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Self esteem dies at the cross and new life begins.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">So the believer can esteem him or herself in Christ and not in self.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Colossians 1:27, Christ in you, the hope of glory.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Main Points:</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>1.<span> The message of the cross - Christ the power of God.</span></b>1 Corinthians <st1:time hour="1" minute="18">1:18</st1:time> 23-24,<span> But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock</span>, and unto the Greeks foolishness; But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The message of the cross is foolish because the cross puts its victim to death.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Galatians <st1:time hour="6" minute="14">6:14</st1:time><span> But</span> God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The cross destroys the sinner.Psalm 104:35, Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless the LORD, O my soul. Praise the LORD.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Paul wrote to the Galatians, I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me. Galatians 2:20.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The old is gone - Crucified with Christ</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">New life is come Christ lives in me.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>a)</strong> The message of the cross does away with human merit.<span> It is not a message of how to improve yourself.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">This message is highly praised by the world because it builds upon what I already am.<span>.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Jesus did not die to make us better people.<span> Jesus died to destroy the old and bring new life.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">If we are concerned about preaching a message that pleases people then we must avoid the message of the cross.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">This is why Paul told Timothy to preach the Word when people want to hear or when they dont want to hear.<span> (2 Timothy 4:2-3)</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">How good I am or how bad I am has no relevance in regard to salvation.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">It is a finished work.<span> Jesus cried it is finished</span>(John <st1:time hour="19" minute="30">19:30</st1:time>).</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Hebrews says that He sat down because the work was done.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Hebrews 10:12-14 But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;<span> From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool. For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>b)</strong> The message of the cross does away with religious merit.<span> The Bible never refers to sacramental grace.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Salvation is not through instalments (baptism, confirmation, etc.).</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Salvation is the gift of God through faith in the finished work of Christ alone.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Personal Testimony</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">My life was changed on a Tuesday night in August 1975 when a team from Living Sound came to <st1:city><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:city>.<span> I sat at the back of the Church. The preacher spoke about the devil sitting on your shoulder and saying go on do it and then after you do it, he condemns you. That night I understood what it meant to be crucified with Christ and I came into new life in Christ. No one in the meeting knew anything had happened. I did nothing but the power of God brought new life and I was never the same again. (Romans 1:16)</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">It was the message of the cross that brought salvation</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span> c) The message of the cross does away with social standing. The Bible places everyone on the same level.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">A person can be a regular churchgoer, live a respectable life, and be regarded as a good Christian.<span> This person will often be well spoken of in the community.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">But the message of the cross is that respectability counts for nothing in regard to salvation.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Good living people often look down on those who have committed evil crimes.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">But the message of the cross is that in the sight of God we are all inherently evil and salvation can only come through death and new life in Christ.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The cross puts to death both the respected and the reviled.<span> It makes no difference.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">This is why it is often easier to preach the message of the cross in prison than it is to preach this message in church.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>2.<span> The message of the cross Christ the wisdom of God.</span></b>1 Corinthians <st1:time hour="1" minute="25">1:25</st1:time>, Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The wisdom of God chose the weak things of the world.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>a)</strong> Victorious King His victory came through the foolishness of the cross.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The cross is foolish because a conquering King puts his enemies to death.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>&gt; A victorious king has an army protecting him.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span> Christ had no army to protect him.
