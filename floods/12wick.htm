<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Away in Yarmouth
God was moving among the Wick fishermen. Around six were converted, some of
them notorious characters. Among these men were Don Rosie and John <span class="SpellE">Flett</span>, both of the motor <span class="GramE">drifter</span>
Brae <span class="SpellE">Flett</span>. One man relates how he walked from <span class="SpellE">Gorleston</span> to </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Yarmouth</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB">. As he walked slowly up </span><st1:street><st1:address><span lang="EN-GB">King Street</span></st1:address></st1:street><span lang="EN-GB">
with no intention of going to any gospel meeting, for he had no interest in
eternal things, he heard singing coming from </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span lang="EN-GB">St. <span class="GramE">George' s</span></span></st1:placename><st1:placetype><span lang="EN-GB">Church</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">, where the Rev. Douglas Brown was conducting services. A power
outside himself drew him into the church. When the appeal was made he responded
by making his way to the front. He fell on his knees and was saved although no
one spoke to him personally, because so many had come forward. This man walked
back to his boat, the <span class="SpellE">Mizpah</span>, which was moored at <span class="SpellE">Gorleston</span> and told his skipper who was the well-known <span class="SpellE">salvationist</span> Billie Stewart. Billie took him down to the
forecastle where the motor drifters had steam boilers to drive their capstans,
prayed and sang the hymn "At the cross, at the cross, where I first saw
the Light". There in the dark part of the fishing boat the assurance of. <span class="GramE">salvation</span> entered that man's soul. The next day, which was a
Sunday, the man was taken along to the Salvation Army in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Yarmouth</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> by Billie
Stew art and Skipper <span class="SpellE">Flett</span> of the Brae <span class="SpellE">Flett</span> where there was much rejoicing over this man's
conversion.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">As the fishermen
of Wick returned home, the converts were alive for God. On </span><st1:date day="23" month="11" year="1921"><span lang="EN-GB">Friday the 23rd November 1921</span></st1:date><span lang="EN-GB">, all these men attended the meeting held by the Pilgrim Preachers

<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span lang="EN-GB">'I will pour water on him that is thirsty, <o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span lang="EN-GB">While you are seeking Me, I will be found.'<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It is reported
that the atmosphere was charged with the power of the Holy Spirit and in the
meeting some precious souls found Christ. After the service Billie gathered all
the young converts together and said, "Boys I'm a Salvationist, I'll be
going to the Salvation Army tomorrow night. If you want to come, "meet me
outside the Army Hall at </span><st1:time hour="7" minute="0"><span lang="EN-GB">7
 o'clock</span></st1:time><span lang="EN-GB">." Captain Reid and Lieutenant
Long were the officers in charge at Wick and they had a real burden for souls.
At that Saturday night meeting things began to happen as God started to move.
When the service was over the converts went out to an open air meeting at the
market place. Sunday was a great day, for souls were saved in every meeting.
Later that evening they went into the open air. Eyewitnesses told of how the
market place was filled with people, one estimate put the number at a thousand.
Men and women witnessed of their new found joy till after </span><st1:time hour="23" minute="0"><span lang="EN-GB">11 p.m.</span></st1:time></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">By Monday, 26th
November, almost the entire population of Wick was talking about the revival.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">There was a deep
sense of' God's presence. At an open-air service on the Brae-Head above the
harbour at the <span class="SpellE">Pulteney</span> side of Wick these young
souls, some only converted for a few hours, boldly testified of <span class="GramE">Christ' s</span> redeeming power. Two well known young fishermen
came out of the public house across from the meeting and John <span class="SpellE">Flett</span>, who had recently been saved in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Yarmouth</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB">, went over
to one of them and said, "I believe if you get saved hundreds will follow
and get converted after you<span class="GramE">. "</span> These two men
joined the crowd and went to the market place. Later on the meeting moved to
the Salvation Army Hall which was crowded, some having to sit on the windows.
That night the young man whom John <span class="SpellE">Flett</span> spoke to was
converted and became a Salvationist. Many others found Christ that night. The </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span lang="EN-GB">Baptist</span></st1:placename><st1:placetype><span lang="EN-GB">Church</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB"> was
also packed to capacity with people seeking God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Tuesday the 27th
was the greatest night of all.After the
meetings indoors there was a. tremendous open air service in the market place
where it was estimated that over one hundred and twenty accepted Christ as
their personal Saviour. Witnesses of this great event tell of how hardened men
and women broke down, and with tears of repentance cried upon God for mercy.
The young converts took off their coats and laid them on the ground so that
those who desired could kneel in comfort. From that night the blessing spread
like wildfire.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Those who were
leading the work came under exceptional strain. Conducting meetings, holding
nights of prayer and praise, leading enquirers to Christ all took their toll on
the health of those concerned. Captain Reid of the Salvation Army became ill.
Young Lieutenant Long found herself in charge of the work. God used that young
woman mightily in His service. The open air services at the Brae-Head brought
out large crowds and on several occasions at least four streets were blocked.
Listeners were amazed as the young Christians fluently quoted scripture. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A convert who
later became a Salvation Army Officer, eventually rising to the rank of
Brigadier, tells of these meetings. "I was unsaved and unmoved when the
awakening started. As cashier of the <span class="SpellE">Breadalban</span>
Picture House, I can say that hardly anyone was attending the cinema, at one
showing there were only five present. I would be going to my work at </span><st1:time hour="19" minute="0"><span lang="EN-GB">7 p.m.</span></st1:time><span lang="EN-GB">
when the crowds were so large I could not get through and had to make a detour
around back streets to get to my place of employment." </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Brigadier Rosie
goes on to give her testimony.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"I was saved
in the New Year in the Rifle Hall. The crowds were so large that the Rifle Hall
had to be taken over as it was the only Hall big enough, yet even that was too
small. Six months later I came into the experience of scriptural holiness and
could sing from a clean heart's experience,</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span lang="EN-GB">I'm more than conqueror through His blood, <o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Jesus saves me now, <o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span lang="EN-GB">I rest beneath the shield of God, <o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Jesus saves me now."<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Our sister went to
the Salvation Army Training College and became an officer in many Corps where a
great work was done. Her sweet voice could be heard singing the songs of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Zion</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB">. She testified
that the work done in her heart in 1922 has lasted well over fifty years. When
the Lord builds the house, it stands. During her forty years active service she
has seen wonderful things. "What evidences of God's work there was,"
she said. "One young Christian had a melodeon and he would lead sometimes
well over 500 in a march of witness from the <span class="SpellE">Barrigol</span>
Hall to the Salvation Army." What a sight this must have been.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In these times of
refreshing it was wonderful to witness that all believers were united in
Christ.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The one aim was to
see souls rescued from sin.Mr. Millard
of the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span lang="EN-GB">Baptist</span></st1:placename><st1:placetype><span lang="EN-GB">Church</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB"> was at home on the Salvation Army platform as were the Salvation
Army Officers in his pulpit.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span lang="EN-GB">Baptist</span></st1:placename><st1:placetype><span lang="EN-GB">Church</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB"> in </span><st1:street><st1:address><span lang="EN-GB">Union Street</span></st1:address></st1:street><span lang="EN-GB">
was another place that experienced great blessing.Their minister, the godly Rev. Millard threw
himself into the work with all his heart. He was greatly used in leading men
and women to Christ, and was called upon at all hours to help sin sick souls.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">His church was
constantly filled, most of the time there was standing room only. Prayer
meetings played a very important part in his ministry.The testimony meetings on Sunday afternoons
were special occasions. Don Rosie told of how he stopped smoking six weeks before
he got saved in a meeting run by Douglas Brown at </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span lang="EN-GB">St. George's</span></st1:placename><st1:placetype><span lang="EN-GB">Church</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Yarmouth</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB">. It was
said that he was one of God's gentlemen. He sailed in the motor drifter Brae <span class="SpellE">Flett</span> with the <span class="SpellE">Flett</span> brothers,
and at one time the entire crew were all saved men. Another hard case, an
engineer of a steam drifter said, </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"You ask me
how I know I'm <span class="GramE">saved?</span> I'll tell you.Before I got saved I would find myself under
the bed on a Sunday morning because I was so drunk that I could not get into it
on Saturday night. Now, I am in bed on a Sunday morning for I have never
touched a drop of drink since I got saved." </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">These converts
were new creatures in Christ, and they knew it. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"I'm <span class="GramE">saved,</span> I know I'm saved cried one fisherman. How do I
know?Well, yesterday I went into
Walter' Craig's <span class="SpellE">shoppie</span> and on the counter were some
knives. I could not steal them. Before I got saved I would have had two or
three in my pocket." </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">How these
uneducated men loved to tell in their own way the change that had been wrought
in their lives since Jesus had come to abide in their hearts. They were so keen
to testify that the leader during a meeting had to insist on order as two or
three would have spoken at once.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A Salvation Army
Staff Captain, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Rohu</span> from </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Aberdeen</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB">, arrived
to help in the meetings along with the wife of the officer from <span class="SpellE">Thurso</span>. They proved to be a tremendous asset to those who
had borne the strain of the work in the early days of the awakening. The
meetings continued to gather strength during the month of December and the
young converts stood over the New Year period with their colours flying. At the
turn of the year many of the young men had the joy of seeing their parents
become Christians. There was a marked improvement in the preaching of these
young converts and it became obvious that they had become students of the Bible.
They quoted with accuracy and clarity' as they testified for Christ. During the
first week of January 1922 these young men started to travel to the villages
around Wick to take services. Among the places visited were <span class="SpellE">Ackergill</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Staxigo</span>. Precious souls were converted through
their witness.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Jock Troup arrived
home at Wick on </span><st1:date day="3" month="1" year="1922"><span lang="EN-GB">the 3rd of January 1922</span></st1:date><span lang="EN-GB">. He had
visited </span><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Dundee</span></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB"> after being in <span class="SpellE">Fraserburgh</span> and had seen
God move in both places. These were very busy days for the young
evangelist.The past few months of
strenuous labour for the Master had left him exhausted. He had become hoarse
and was advised to refrain from public speaking for a period. During his
attendance at the meetings held in the <span class="SpellE">Barrigol</span> Hall
it became obvious that his presence brought inspiration into the services.
However, when his throat showed no improvement it was decided that surgery was
necessary. This operation was carried out in the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span lang="EN-GB">Bignol</span></span></st1:placename><st1:placetype><span lang="EN-GB">Hospital</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">, Wick. With loving care and attention Jock was soon his own self
again.His return to the work was
greeted with great enthusiasm.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A special Gospel
Rally was held in the United Free Church. This was his first engagement since
the operation. Witnesses declare that it was a meeting "out of this
world".The place was packed to
capacity, chairs filled the aisles and there were people sitting on the pulpit
steps. His text for that night was, "Ye must be born again." People
who knew him in days past had to recognise that he carried the seal of God's
approval on his life and work.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The Master's call
was heavy upon Jock, for it was not long before he started to travel. God's
work in Wick went on, with the tide continuing to rise in blessing. One notable
feature was that the young converts grasped every opportunity to witness for
Christ. Jock made many new friends among them. One of these was a young man who
had been saved only a few months earlier through the Pilgrim Preachers. From
the beginning of his Christian life this young man showed great promise, and he
travelled with Jock around </span><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Caithness</span></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB"> holding meetings in halls and churches. He told me that they were
praying one night at 11.30.Jock said,
"Angie, we must go out and have an open-air." Although it was late
they went into the Market Place where they sang and preached.Doors and windows were opened as people came
to listen. It was a marvellous night. Men and women collapsed in the street
under the conviction of the Holy Spirit. As Angie told me about that occasion in
his home at <span class="SpellE">Torry</span> in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Aberdeen</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB">, my heart
was amazed at the wonderful way in which God works. Tears were in his eyes as
he remembered souls lying in the gutters crying on Christ for mercy.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Jock found it hard
to get away to the quiet place. In a crowded home it was not easy to escape the
publicity he attracted. Often he would go down to the old sail-boats which were
moored on the river at Wick. There he cried alone to God in prayer. Sometimes
Angie joined him.In later years these
days became precious memories.Angie was
later to associate himself with the Open Brethren. For over fifty years he has
proved to be a faithful Bible teacher and evangelist.Many have found Christ through his ministry
in the Brethren Assemblies, especially in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Scotland</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span lang="EN-GB">.I counted it a privilege to meet one who has
