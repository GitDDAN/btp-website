<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-GB">SOUTH FIRTH<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The "South
Firth" fishermen hailed from the fishing towns situated along the north
and south coasts of the Firth of Tay. They had a herring season of their own in
the winter months, but during the year they followed the herring from the North
of Scotland right down to </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">East Anglia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Just south of the
Bass Rock, on which the Scottish Covenanters were imprisoned in terrible
conditions during the 16th century, <span class="GramE">lies</span> the fishing </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span lang="EN-GB">port</span></st1:placetype><span lang="EN-GB"> of </span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span lang="EN-GB">Eyemouth</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">. Proudly many of them sailed their boats south for the 1921 season.
A goodly number of them were to hear and believe the Gospel of Christ. The
impact of this was felt when the converts returned home. These after-<span class="SpellE">effect<span class="GramE">,s</span></span> were very much in
evidence when Jock Troup and another evangelist returned to the town years
later. As the two servants of Christ held an open-air meeting, crowds gathered
around. There were some who saw for the first time the man whom God had used to
bring many to <span class="GramE">a knowledge</span> of Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Between <span class="SpellE">Eyemouth</span> and Edinburgh, on the south side of the Firth of
Forth, are the fishing towns of <span class="SpellE">Cockenzie</span>, Port
Seton, Musselburgh and <span class="SpellE">Fisherow</span>. <span class="GramE">The
breath of God's Spirit swept across the folks from these places in a tremendous
way.</span> At </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Yarmouth</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> that year was big John J </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE"><span lang="EN-GB">ames</span></span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> Horne of Port Seton. He stood six feet tall, his huge size being
evident at the services in the </span><st1:street><st1:address><span lang="EN-GB">Market Square</span></st1:address></st1:street><span lang="EN-GB">.
He became a personal friend of Jock Troup and was amongst the front liners at
any meeting, whether it was inside a church or in the open air. I had the
opportunity to meet John James while I was conducting some meetings in Port
Seton and enjoyed the fellowship in his home. Abiding results can be seen in <span class="SpellE">Cockenzie</span> and Port Seton today if you visit any of the
churches or meeting halls, but especially in the </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Mission</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> known as
"The Fishermen's </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Bethel</span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="GramE"><span lang="EN-GB">. "</span></span><span lang="EN-GB"> It was
from around this district that a young man got saved during the early <span class="GramE">1920' s</span>. He was to be one of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="GramE"><span lang="EN-GB">Scotland</span></span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class="GramE"><span lang="EN-GB">' s</span></span><span lang="EN-GB"> unique
evangelists, leading many to Christ, a number of whom became missionaries on
foreign fields. That man was none other than Charlie Main.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">As with other
places associated with the sea, Musselburgh and <span class="SpellE">Fisherow</span>
have long known the satisfaction and hardship of earning a living from the deep.
These towns were to know spiritual success during 1921. Quite a few men were
saved and on returning home they set revival fires burning that are still
alight today. From this area came Robert <span class="SpellE">Fairnie</span>.
This man of God has done a great work for the Lord in the North East of
Scotland and latterly in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Bristol</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB">. No doubt the men who were saved in 1921 had an influence on his
life.</span></p>

<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">On the north side
of the Firth of Forth there are four lovely small towns each with a long <span class="SpellE">asociation</span> with fishing. A number of men from these places
were converted at </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Yarmouth</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB">. Among them was my uncle, Alex "Hughie" Hughes. After
being spoken to by God through tragedy in his family, he closed in with <span class="GramE">God' s</span> offer of mercy during the revival. His consistent
Christian life was a constant rebuke to men and women.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Although he did
not speak publicly, his life told for Jesus. Hughie was a gentleman for God,
faithful to <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">theiast</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> he knew his anchor gripped the Solid Rock.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">An evangelical
Congregational Church stands as a testimony for God, showing that men and women
knew the blessing of the Lord in 1921. A Brethren Assembly meets in St. <span class="SpellE">Monance</span> with members attending whose parents were saved
during the revival.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">One Tuesday night
in November 1921, a lassie about seven years old came home from the <span class="SpellE">Pittenweem</span> <span class="GramE">school</span> for her dinner.
Her mother sat in a chair crying. Her tears were not of sorrow, but of joy. She
had just received a letter from her husband John Hughes telling her that he had
been saved the previous weekend at </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Yarmouth</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">That lassie did
not get much to eat that day<span class="GramE">,because</span> her mother was so overwhelmed. Although only young, an
impression was left on her heart and mind which she can recall with joy nearly
sixty years later. When the <span class="SpellE">fisherfolk</span> returned to <span class="SpellE">Pitenweem</span> they brought back revival blessing with them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Recently the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span lang="EN-GB">Scottish</span></st1:placename><st1:placename><span lang="EN-GB">Fisheries</span></st1:placename><st1:placetype><span lang="EN-GB">Museum</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB"> was
opened up in <span class="SpellE">Anstruther</span>. The exhibits show a
fascinating history of the fishing industry. "<span class="SpellE">Anster</span>",
as it is locally known, had a great page written into the annals of God's Book
of Life. A number of souls from this town were converted. The move went on
after the fishermen had returned from </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Yarmouth</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">At <span class="SpellE">Cellardyke</span> the meetings were so large during the months of
December 1921 and <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">january</span></span>
1922, that the only convenient place available was the Town Hall. Crowds
attended the services which were conducted by local fishermen. Many responded
to the forthright preaching of God's word.</span></p>
