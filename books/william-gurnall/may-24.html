<br/>
<p class="Default"><span class="GramE"><b><span>The Inward Principle of Prayer.</span></b></span><b></b></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span class="GramE"><span>'In the Spirit.<span>'</span></span></span></p>
<h4>[To pray in the spirit, we must have KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING.]</h4>
<p>1. To pray acceptably, or in the spirit, it is required
that we pray with knowledge and understanding. <o:p></o:p></p>
<br/>
<p class="Default"><span>A blind sacrifice was rejected
in the law, Malachi 1:8; much more are blind devotions under the gospel. As
knowledge aggravates a sin, so ignorance takes from the <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">excellency</span></span> of an action that is good: 'I bear them
witness,' <span class="SpellE">says</span> Paul, 'they have a zeal, but not
according to knowledge.' The want of an eye disfigures the fairest face, the
want of knowledge the <span class="SpellE">devoutest</span> prayer: 'You worship
you know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews,' John
4:22, where we see what a fundamental defect the want of knowledge is in acts
of worship, such as brings damnation with it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default"><b><span>Question</span></b><span> First. But why is
knowledge so requisite to acceptable praying? <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default"><b><span>Answer</span></b><span> First. <span class="GramE">Because without this it is not a 'reasonable service;' for we know
not what we do.</span> God calls for 'reasonable service,' Romans 12:1, which
some oppose to the legal sacrifices. They offered up beasts to God; in the
gospel we are to offer up ourselves. Now the soul and spirit of a man is the
man. Why did not God lay a law on beasts to worship him, but because they have
not a rational soul to understand and reflect upon their own actions? And will
God accept that service and worship from man, wherein he does not exercise that
faculty that distinguishes him from a beast? 'Show <span class="GramE">yourselves</span>
men,' says the prophet to those idolaters, Isaiah 46:8. And truly he that worships the true God ignorantly is brutish in his knowledge as well as he that <span class="GramE">prays</span> to a false god. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default"><b><span>Answer</span></b><span> Second. <span class="GramE">Because the understanding is the leading faculty of the soul, and
so the key of the work.</span> The inward worship of the heart is the chief.
Now, the other powers of the soul are disabled if they want <span class="GramE">this
their</span> guide which holds the candle to them. As for those violent
passions of seeming zeal, sorrow, and joy, which sometimes appear in ignorant
worshippers and their blind devotions, they are spurious. Christ's sheep, like
Jacob's, conceive by the eye. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default"><span><span>1.</span></span><span>The saint's eye is enlightened to see the majesty and
glorious holiness of God, and then it reveres him, and mourns before him in the
sense of his own vileness: 'Now my eye <span class="SpellE">sees</span> you,
wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes,' Job 42:6. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default"><span><span>2.</span></span><span>Again, by an eye of faith he beholds the goodness and
love of God to poor sinners in <span class="GramE">Christ,</span> and in
particular to him, and this eye affects his heart to love and rely on him,
which it is impossible the ignorant soul should do. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default"><b><span>Question</span></b><span> First. But you will
say, what is necessary for the praying soul to know? <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default"><b><span>Answer</span></b><span> First. There is required
a knowledge that he to whom he directs his prayer is the true God. Religious
worship is an incommunicable flower in the crown of the deity, and that both
inward and outward. We are religiously to worship him only, who, by reason of
his infinite perfections, deserves our supreme love, honour, and trust. He must
have the crown that owes the kingdom. 'The kingdom and power' <span class="GramE">are</span> God's. Therefore 'the glory' of religious worship
belongs to him alone, Matthew 6:13. Angels are the highest order of creatures,
but we are forbid to 'worship any of the host of heaven,' Deuteronomy 17:3. 'Who
would not fear You, O King of nations? <span class="GramE">for</span> to You it
does appertain'-where fear is put for religious worship, as appears by the
circumstance of the place. The want of this knowledge filled the heathen world
with idolatry. For, where they found any virtue or <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">excellency</span></span> in the creature, presently they adored and
worshipped it, like some ignorant rustic, who coming to court, thinks every one
he sees in brave clothes to be the king. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default"><b><span>Answer</span></b><span> Second. There is
required a knowledge of this true God, what his nature is. 'He that comes to
God must believe that he is, and that he is a <span class="SpellE">rewarder</span>
of them that diligently seek him,' Hebrews 11:6. It is confessed, a perfect
knowledge of the divine perfections is incomprehensible by a finite being. He
answered right who said-when asked what is God?-if I knew, I myself would be
God. None indeed knows God thus but God himself; yet <span class="GramE">a
Scripture</span> knowledge of him is necessary to the right performance of this
duty. The want of understanding his omniscience and infinite mercy, is the
cause of vain babbling, and a conceit to prevail by long prayers, which our
Saviour charges upon the heathen, and prevents in his disciples by acquainting
them with these attributes, Matthew 6:7, 8. They came rather to inform God than
to beg. The ignorance of his high and glorious majesty is the cause why so many
are rude and slovenly in their gesture, so saucy and irreverently familiar with
God in their expressions. We are bid to 'be sober, watching unto prayer.' Truly
there is an insobriety in our very language, when we do not clothe the desires
of our hearts with such humble expressions as may signify the awe and dread of
his sacred majesty in our hearts. In a word, the reason why men dare come <span class="GramE">reeking</span> out of the adulterous embraces of their lusts, and
stretch forth their unwashed hands to heaven in prayer-whence is it? -but
because they know not God to be of such infinite purity as will have no
fellowship with the workers of iniquity? 'You thought that I was altogether
such <span class="GramE">an</span> one as yourself,' Psalm 50:21. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default"><b><span>Answer</span></b><span> Third. We must
understand the matter of our prayers, what we beg, what we deprecate. Without
this we cannot in faith say amen to our own prayers, but may soon ask that
which neither becomes us to desire, nor is honourable for God to give. This
Christ rebuked, when she in the gospel put up her ambitious request for her
children to be set one at the right the other at the left hand of Christ in his
kingdom. God never gave us leave thus to <span class="SpellE">indite</span> our
own prayers by the dictate of our private spirit, but has bound us up to ask
only what he has promised to give. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default"><b><span>Answer</span></b><span> Fourth. There is
required a knowledge of the manner how we are to pray; as, in whose name, and
what qualifications are required in the prayer and person praying. We find Paul
begging prayers, 'that you strive together with me in your prayers.' In another
place he tells us of a lawful striving, 2 Timothy 2:5. There is a law of prayer
which must be observed, or we come at our own adventure. Even in false worship
they go by some rule in their addresses to their gods. Therefore those
smattering Samaritans, when a plague was on them, concluded the reason to be
because they 'knew not the manner of the god of the land,' 2 Kings 17:26. The
true God will be served in due order, or else expect a breach. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default"><span class="GramE"><span>A word or two
for application of this branch.</span></span></p>
<p class="Default"><span class="GramE"><span>[Use or
Application.]</span></span></p>
<p class="Default"><b><span>Use First.</span></b><span> How few then pray in
the spirit! <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default"><span class="GramE"><span>Were this</span></span><span> the only character to try many by, would they not be
cast over the bar for mere babblers? <span class="GramE">As, first, those in the
Popish church, where most know not a word what they say in prayer.</span> If it
be such a weakness to subscribe a petition to a king, or to a parliament, which
we never read or understood, what shall we then think of such brutish prayers
as these sent to heaven and indorsed with an ignoramus on the back of them?
Yea, amongst <span class="GramE">ourselves</span>, many, who though they pray in
their mother language, yet are as ignorant as to the matter of their prayers;
how else could they patter over the creed and commandments with their blind
devotion instead of prayers? Are there more deplored ruins of mankind to be
found among the Indians than such? Yea, when they join with their minister in
prayer, neither <span class="GramE">know</span> that God to whom the prayer is
directed, nor the Mediator under the favour of whose name it is presented. Before
<span class="SpellE">Nebuchadnezzar</span> could bless God, he had the
understanding of a man given him, which these yet want. Do you not think such
ignorant wretches as these might be easily persuaded to kneel before an image
gaudily dressed up, or to put their letter into some angel or saint's hand for
despatch, being made to believe that it will find a kinder welcome by the
mediation of such favourites? O what <span class="GramE">a darkness</span> is
there even at this day upon the face of our waters! <span class="GramE">on</span>
which, had but the pope's instruments opportunity to sit brooding awhile, they
might soon bring their desired work to a perfection among the multitude of
ignorant souls that are amidst us! We see there is need not only to stir up our
people to pray, or else we send them before they have learned their errand, as
if we should call a child to read before he hath learned his letters. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default"><b><span>Use Second.</span></b><span> It speaks to all
that are at any time the mouth to God for others in prayer, so to pray, that
those who join with them may clearly understand what they put up to God for
them. Who is more to be blamed-he that prays in an unknown tongue, or he that
with such uncouth phrases and high-flown expressions as are not understood by
half the company? Suppose your own spirit prays, as the apostle says, yet your understanding
is unfruitful unto them. They, alas! <span class="GramE">are</span> at a loss,
and stand gazing, as the disciples did when the cloud parted Christ from them.
Either come down from thy high towering expressions, or help them up to you.
They may say of you as those of Moses, 'We know not what is become of the man.'
No wonder if, while they cannot keep sight of the matter in <span class="GramE">hand,
that</span> their thoughts rove and dance about some object of their own
framing. Do you pray to be admired for your <span class="SpellE">rouling</span>
tongue, height of gifts, or the like? Perhaps you may have <span class="GramE">this
your</span> reward of some ignorant ones, and others that would as fain commend
themselves upon the same account; but consider what a low and base end you
propound in so high a service, unworthy of a Christian's thought. What! <span class="GramE">no</span> net to fish with for your credit and applause but a
sacred ordinance! The whip which Christ made in the gospel belongs to your
back. Our blessed Saviour, that was all on fire with zeal to see his house of
prayer made a house of merchandise, O how does his soul loathe the baseness of your
mercenary spirit, who does the same, though in another dress! <o:p></o:p></span></p>
