<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-GB">JOCK TROUP<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Jock decided in 1922 that his Bible
knowledge was limited so he enrolled at the famous Bible Training Institute in </span><st1:address><st1:street><span lang="EN-GB">Bothwell Street</span></st1:street><span lang="EN-GB">, </span><st1:city><span lang="EN-GB">Glasgow</span></st1:city></st1:address><span lang="EN-GB">. At that
time the principal was Dr. David McIntyre and God used this intellectual
servant of His to mould the young evangelist.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Jock would constantly be having prayer
meet­ings in his room at all hours of the day and night, and although this
created some problems for Dr. McIntyre in his responsibility for the other students,
the godly principal used all his wisdom and knowledge in making Jock realise
that rules had to be kept. Some students testified that these times of prayer
were a tremendous blessing to their souls, and set them an example of how to
pray through and claim the blessing from heaven.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It was during these days that Jock met
another young man who was fired with the power of Christ. When that young man
arrived at the Bible Training Institute, he hardly knew how to use a fork and
knife. Peter Connolly was born and brought up a Roman Catholic in a poor home
in the North of England. From the moment he was saved his life began to speak
volumes for the power of salvation. Soon a bond of love, unity and desire to
work for Christ grew between these two and they were con­stantly called upon to
conduct campaigns together during college days. Both of them found the
discipline. hard at the Institute, yet later on they often paid tribute to the
help and encouragement they received. On one occasion Jock and Peter complained
about a certain lecturer who had not mentioned Jesus Christ in his lecture. The
prin­cipal asked for their notes and they told him that they had disposed of
them. He took time and patience to explain to his two over zealous students
that the lecture had been on the Children of Israel in the Wilderness.
Travelling together in gospel campaigns around </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Britain</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span lang="EN-GB">,
they won many for Christ. They would spend days and nights in prayer, even
fasting when the heavens seemed as brass, with no one professing conversion.
Tears would be shed as these men bound the enemy of souls, laying hold on the
Word of God that declares, "Whatsoever ye bind on earth, it shall be bound
in heaven." The two warriors knew that the secret of blessing was based in
powerful praying. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In many fishing towns along the Scottish
coast there are still those who remember missions being conducted by Peter and
Jock. Over the next years they travelled exten­sively. In 1932 Jock was invited
to become Assistant Superintendent to Mr. P. T. McRostie at the Tent Hall in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Glasgow</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB">. The Tent
Hall was situated in the Saltmarket part of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Glasgow</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB">. It was
built after Moody and Sankey held their cam­paigns in the city. Since then it
had been a centre of evangelism. This new ministry in a more settled sphere
provided Jock with a fresh challenge which he met with the help of the Lord.
Jock by this time had found a help-mate who hailed from Wick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Mr. McRostie died in 1933 and Jock was
asked to take full responsibility for the work at the famous Tent Hall. At that
time it was one of the largest independent missions in the land. He accepted
the challenge and was Superintendent until 1945. During those years Jock fought
against every evil that abounded in the city of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Glasgow</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB">. The war
years were used as an opportunity to bring the gospel to the armed forces and
supply weary travellers with meals. No doubt Jock's mind would go back to </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Dublin</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> during the
1914-18 war, when Mr. &amp; Mrs. West provided similar facilities which were
instrumental in bringing him to Christ.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">His open-air services at the Glasgow
Cross were blessed times when his tremendous voice could be heard singing and
preaching ever Saturday afternoon. He made sure that his meetings were always
bright, whether it was out in campaigns or in the more organised atmosphere of
the Tent Hall. One of his saying was, "There is no warrant in Scripture to
tell us that a gospel service should be conducted like a funeral."In Tent Hall days Jock invited many powerful
ministers and evangelists to </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Glasgow</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> for special meetings. Men like the well-known Bible expositor
Donald Barnhouse. The evangelist W. P. Nicholson came and his ministry was
blessed by the salvation of souls.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Jock never lost the urge to travel in
order to preach the gospel. He had realised earlier on that he was called to be
an evangelist and never lost that sense of call. However, the years had taken
their toll on his health and after some ill­ness he resigned from the
leadership of the Tent Hall in 1945. Many folks speak yet of those days, and
there are many who are proud to have been associated with him in the work of
the Gospel. He never lost his love for the Salvation Army. During his frequent
visits to Wick he always vis­ited the Corps there. He took great delight in
appealing for funds for the Salvation Army picnic for children in Wick. In the
open-air at the Camps in Wick he would cry out for all those who could afford
to give £1 notes, then for those who were able to give 10/- notes and last of
all he would ask for the snow (silver) to cover the paper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">When a Wick Salvationist was being
interviewed as a candidate for Officership by Commissioner Jeffries he was
asked, "Do you know a John Troup?" "I know a Jock Troup,"
replied the candidate. ''Well," said the Commissioner,. "I in­vited
him to become an officer in the Salvation Army, but he felt he could not stand
the discip­line.Jock is reported to
have said at least once, "If 1 had my life to live over again, I would be
a Salvation Army Officer."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">After Jock's health began to improve, he
start­ed to travel again and conduct missions throughout </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Britain</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span lang="EN-GB">.He also went abroad.In </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">America</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span lang="EN-GB">
he was greatly loved as an old-fashioned Gospel preacher. Many souls were saved
in the camp­aigns he held across that vast continent. It was on one of these
tours that he received his call to "higher service". At the
commencement of a campaign in </span><st1:state><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Washington</span></st1:place></st1:state><span lang="EN-GB">, which was to last six days, he had just started his message, gave
out his text saying, "What else can I say but ye must be born again?"
At that moment he passed from time into the immediate presence of the Master he
served and loved. From that night in 1918 in the wheelhouse of the drifter
Strombo, until he went home to glory on </span><st1:date day="18" month="4" year="1954"><span lang="EN-GB">the 18th of April 1954</span></st1:date><span lang="EN-GB">, the Christ Who saved him, kept him in every battle and trial. God
took His servant home to heaven with his "boots on", preaching the
old Gospel he loved and defended. Often in conversation with his dear wife he
had declared that he wished to pass on whilst on active service. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Jock was not an old man, but the
thirty-six years of Christian experience were packed to cap­acity .in the
service of Christ. Truly he could say, "I, love my Master, I will not go
out free."He has gone down in the
annals of the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span lang="EN-GB">Evangelical</span></st1:placename><st1:placetype><span lang="EN-GB">Church</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB"> as one of the greatest evangelists </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Scotland</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span lang="EN-GB">
has ever produced. It was his responsibility and privilege to be one of the few
men entrusted to be at the "helm" in a time of spiritual awakening.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">One of Jock's favourite choruses was, .<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><i>"Just a little longer, and the trump of
God will sound,<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Just a little longer, and we'll
all be glory bound.<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Look away to Jesus, your
redemption draweth nigh ,.­<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Just a little longer, and
we'll meet Him in the sky."<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">His melodious voice has been preserved
for posterity on quite a few gramophone records. He sang the old hymns' with a
"tremendous depth of conviction seldom found in modern gospel soloists.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Many of the renowned evangelical leaders
paid tribute to Jock and lamented that a great man and a prince had
"fallen in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Israel</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span lang="EN-GB">". His lifetime friend Peter Connely said when he heard of
Jock's untimely death, "I have lost my dearest friend. He wept long and
uncontrollably for the souls of men and women that his eyes were like balls of
fire. </span><span lang="DA">He taught me how to
pray."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
