<p><strong>Course: The Ministry of the Holy Spirit in the New
Testament Church. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Course
Title: The Gifts of the Spirit (10 Lessons)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introductory Lesson One: </strong></p>
<strong>
<p><strong>Lesson Title: The Manifestations
of the Spirit</strong></p>
<p><strong>Text: </strong>1 Corinthians
12:7-11 But the manifestation of the Spirit is given
to every man to profit withal. For to one is given by the Spirit the word of
wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; To another faith by the same Spirit;
to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; To another the working of miracles; to
another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another <em>divers</em> kinds
of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues: But all these worketh
that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction: </strong>Manifestations of the Spirit given to each
one in order to profit all</p></strong> 1 Corinthians 12:7, 'But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.'
<strong>
<p>1) The word profit is the Greek word 'sumphero' which literally means to 'carry together'. We are one body in Christ, called to build one another up in Christ. The Holy Spirit moves through the whole body. We have different roles to fulfil, but when Christ is our life then we are one in Him. We are not clergy and laity.</p>
<strong>
<p>2) All believers are priests unto God. We minister Christ together: His life; His word; and His power work in us equipping us for ministry. Together we grow in Christ offering as priests a heart filled with thanksgiving and praise; a life filled with love for the Lord Jesus Christ; and a mind set to obey His word and to walk in His ways.</p>
<strong>
<p>3) Not all believers have the same function within the body. The gifts of the Spirit function through the whole body of Christ but different individuals will be known for operating in specific kinds of gifts. This helps the body of Christ to multiply, grow, and develop. </p>
<strong>
<p><strong>Manifestations are listed by the kind of person to whom the gift is given.</strong></p>
<p>Scripture divides the list of the nine gifts of the Spirit into three groups by using the words 'allos' meaning one of the same kind and 'heteros' meaning one of a different kind.</p>
<strong>
<p>1) Revelation. To one kind of person is given manifestations to know.</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 12:8 </p>
<p>For to one is given by the Spirit the word
of wisdom; </p>
<p>to another (heteros)
the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;</p>
<p>2) Power in confrontation. Another kind of person is given
manifestations to do and to see.</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 12:9-10 </p>
<p>To another (heteros)
faith by the same Spirit; </p>
<p>to
another (allos) the gifts of healing by the same
Spirit;</p>
<p>To another (allos)
the working of miracles; </p>
<p>to
another (allos) prophecy; </p>
<p>to another (allos)
discerning of spirits; </p>
<strong>
<p>3)
Exaltation. Another kind of person is given
manifestations to worship.</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 12:10 </p>
<p>to
another (heteros)divers kinds of tongues; </p>
<p>to another
(allos) the interpretation of tongues:</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit ministers to the body of
Christ and through the body of Christ. </p>
<p>Every member of the body is necessary for
building up of the body. </p>
<p>The manifestations of the Spirit are given
to different kinds of people. </p>
<p><strong>Introductory
illustration: </strong><strong>Battle</strong><strong> of </strong><strong>Britain</strong><strong> (1940).</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>In the 2<sup>nd</sup> World War Britain
was saved from invasion by the victory in the air known as the Battle of
Britain.</p>
<p>Three reasons for victory </p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>development of radar; It was said that the British spread the
 rumour that the pilots ate carrots to improve their eyesight. The truth was the development of
 radar. </li>
<li>the superiority of aircraft (spitfire and hurricane); </li>
<li>the skill of the pilots to be able to take off at short notice.</li>
</ul>
<p>A war can
also be lost because of low morale.</p>
<p><a href="churchill.html" target="_blank">Speeches
of Winston Churchill</a> Their Finest Hour
and The Few</p>
<p>Lifted morale
 word of encouragement</p>
<p>When the war
was won the people rejoiced by gathering around Buckingham Palace. Celebration drew them to the King.</p>
<p>The Gifts of the Spirit work the same way.</p>
<p>Wisdom and knowledge is the radar giving direction, guiding, and
 warning.</p>
<p>The second group provides the power to overcome the enemy.</p>
<p>The third group brings celebration in the Holy Spirit, glorifying the Lord in joyous victory.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Main
Points:</strong></p>
<p><!--[if !supportLists]-->1.      <!--[endif]-->Gods radar. Gifts that
provide revelation of particular facts. For
to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of
knowledge by the same Spirit; (1 Corinthians 12:8). </p>
<p>A Word of Wisdom information that enables the body of Christ to understand the plan and purpose of God in a particular situation.</p>
<p>It is the revelation of future events so that the body of Christ can
understand the times and act accordingly.</p>
<p>For example Agabus reveals a time of
famine (Acts 11:28-30). The church is prepared and sends relief to Jerusalem before it
happens.</p>
<p>A Word of Knowledge information that enables the body of
 Christ to know hidden things.</p>
<p>It is the revelation of present events so that the body of Christ
are aware of what is taking place in peoples lives or in a particular place.</p>
<p>For example 
Jesus revealed to the woman at Samaria His
knowledge of her life (John
4:18).</p>
<p>She had been in 5 marriages and now lived in sin. The woman came to recognise that Jesus is the
Messiah.</p>
<p>The revelation of a Word of Wisdom and a
Word of Knowledge is the supernatural revelation of certain facts that could
not have been known naturally. It is
Gods radar for the church providing information so the body of Christ can be
prepared and effective </p>
<p><!--[if !supportLists]-->2.     
<!--[endif]-->Manifestations that enable the
body to confront the enemy and empower the body to overcome, To
another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same
Spirit; To another the working of
miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; (1
Corinthians 12:9-10).</p>
<p>The word gifts is
 charismata gifts of grace. The
 character of God is gracious.</p>
<p>Gifts for direct confrontation to overcome the enemy, 'faith; gifts of healing; working of miracles; prophecy; discerning of spirits'.</p>
<p>The operation of the power gifts empowers the body of Christ to do
the works that Jesus did. </p>
<p>Jesus came to destroy the works of the devil. </p>
<p>For example Paul at Lystra. Acts 14:8-10 And
there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his
feet, being a cripple from his mothers womb, who never had walked: The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith
to be healed, Said with a loud voice, Stand
upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked.</p>
<p>The operation of the gifts can repel
 the obstructive methods of the enemy.
 Acts 13:9-11 Then Saul, (who also <em>is called</em>
 Paul,) filled with the Holy Ghost, set his eyes on him, And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, <em>thou</em> child of the
 devil, <em>thou</em> enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to
 pervert the right ways of the Lord?
 And now, behold, the hand of the Lord <em>is</em> upon thee, and thou
 shall be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there
 fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead
 him by the hand. </p>
<p>3. Manifestations
that are given to lift the church to higher realms of prayer; praise; and
worship (Tongues and interpretation of tongues). 1 Corinthians 12:10 to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the
interpretation of tongues:</p>
<p>The Manifestations of the Spirit will
always glorify the Lord Jesus Christ but tongues and interpretation of tongues
are given specifically for prayer, praise and worship. </p>
<p>It is the church gathering around the throne
of God. Glorifying the
Lord heirs of the Father and joint heirs with the Son. Romans 8:14-17</p>
<p>The Gift of tongues on the
 Day of Pentecost empowered the believers to worship in the Holy
 Spirit. .Acts
 2: 4 And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak
 with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. They
 spoke of the wonderful works of God in other tongues. Acts
 2:11.</p>
<p>Tongues are given to empower believers in their prayer life. 1
 Corinthians 14:2 For he that speaks in an <em>unknown</em>
 tongue speaks not unto men, but unto God: for no man understands <em>him</em>;
 howbeit in the spirit he speaks mysteries. </p>
<p>Tongues and interpretation are given that others can join in
 giving thanks unto God. 1 Corinthians 14:15-16.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion: The Holy Spirit will bear testimony that
Jesus is Lord. </strong></p>
<p>1 Corinthians 12:3 'Wherefore I give you to understand,
that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed: and <em>that</em>
no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.' </p>
<p>The Lord Jesus was accursed once on the cross
when He took our sins upon Himself. He
is no longer accursed. </p>
<p>His death took our away our sin. (2 Corinthians 5:21)</p>
<p>His resurrection brought new life. (Colossians 3:1-3)</p>
<p>His ascension lifted us to be seated in
heavenly places in Christ (Ephesians 2:6)</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is now exalted far above all
(Ephesians 1:20-21) and He represents us. </p>
<p>The evidence that Jesus Christ is Lord is
seen when the gifts of the Holy Spirit operate through the body of Christ.</p>
<strong>
<p>The manifestations of the Holy Spirit
through the body of Christ bear testimony that Jesus Christ is Lord. </p>
<strong><strong>
<p><strong>Summary: </strong></p>
<p>The manifestations of the Spirit are given to
the body of Christ for the benefit of building up the body of Christ.</p>
<p>It provides the body of Christ with</p>
<p>1.      Radar 
providing revelatory information. </p>
<p>2.      Power to
overcome all obstacles. </p>
<p>3.      Power to
Pray and Praise prayer and worship in the Holy Spirit.<strong> </strong></p>
