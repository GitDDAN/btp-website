The love of Christians was expressed through giving and praying for him. The love of his family was seen in all they did and continue to do for him.

Often the disciples argued about who was the greatest. Even at the Last Supper the disciples argued about who was the greatest.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">After the resurrection of Jesus, the disciples never argued over who was the greatest.<span> They did not seek to build big ministries but sought only to preach and teach and build up the body of Christ in love.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Applying the words of Jesus to ministry</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">When people pay little attention to what we are doing and have little respect for us be glad for it and minister joyfully and give 100% to everything you do.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>&gt; Dont strive to be big.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"&gt; Rejoice when others are bigger than us.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>&gt; Dont seek to be honoured.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"&gt; Have no concern about being unnoticed.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>&gt; Always serve joyfully.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Churches seek to be bigger</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Ministries seek to be successful</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Ministries that are big and successful are highly respected.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Ministries that are small have little influence.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Leaders of big congregations will be respected as men or women of influence</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">How big a leader depends on the amount of people he or she leads.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Jesus did not associate leadership with numbers.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">He associated leadership with love and humility.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Illustration:</b><span> <b>Not seeking a successful ministry but serving joyfully with love and humility.</b></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">When I first became involved in ministry I had the desire to build up a successful ministry.<span> I knew the Lord was with me and I was daring, and willing to step out in faith when others would not.
