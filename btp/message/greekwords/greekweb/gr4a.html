says unto him,Which? Jesus said,Youshall do no murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You
shall not bear false witness, Honour your father and your mother: and, You
shall love your neighbour as yourself. The young man says unto him,Allthese things
have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet? Jesus said unto him,Ifyou will be perfect, go

cleave unto the Lord. For he was a good
man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and much people was added unto
the Lord.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-GB">Main
Points:</span></b></p>
<p><b>1. The Rich Young Ruler needed to recognise the person of Jesus.</b></p>
<p>The Rich Young Ruler approached Jesus using the word <span class="SpellE">agathos</span>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">There is
confusion over this passage. Jesus asked
the Rich Young Ruler Why do you call <span class="GramE">Me</span> good, there
is none good but God. He did not tell
the young man not to say it but only drew his attention to what he had said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Jesus was the
Master Teacher and he spoke to the man with the intention of guiding him into
truth.</span></p>
<p><a href="deductive.html"><span class="text-primary">Deductive Reasoning</span></a></p>
<p>Jesus used deductive reasoning with the Rich Young Ruler.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">First of all Jesus drew the mans attention
to what he had said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The logic of his words could only leave one
conclusion that Jesus is God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Good (<span class="SpellE">agathos</span>)
Master</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Why do you call ME good? There is none good but God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Deductive reasoning begins with a
proposition (Only God is good)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Then we associate the subject with the
proposition (Jesus is good)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">From this we draw the conclusion (Jesus is
God)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">If the proposition is right the conclusion
must be right.</span></p>
<p><b>2. The need to recognise the bankruptcy of good works.</b></p>
<br/>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Jesus then continued to answer the question
of the Rich Young Ruler: </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">He came to Jesus seeking to be justified by
his deeds what good thing must I do to inherit eternal life?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">No matter how good he was, his conscience
told him he wasnt good enough. This is
seen by the fact that he asked Jesus this question.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Jesus did not give an immediate answer as
He needed to guide Him into truth.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">He did not just say follow <span class="GramE">Me</span>.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">He had to remove the Rich Young Rulers
trust in his own deeds.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">So He leads him first by telling him to do
what he already tried to do.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Jesus said keep the commandments.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In Marks gospel it says defraud not 
this was not a specific commandment but it is commandment derived from the
others do not covet, do not steal, do not lie.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Notice Jesus doesnt mention the
commandments in relation to Love the Lord your God, but only Love your
neighbour as yourself.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">This is because the question was what good
(<span class="SpellE">agathos</span>) thing must I do and Jesus was dealing with
the issue of doing good <span class="SpellE">agathos</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Definition:A good (<span class="SpellE">agathos</span>)
heart is one that instead of working ill to a neighbour, acts beneficially
towards him.(Vines)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The rich young ruler believed he had always
done this. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The result was that the German people did

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The Treaty of Versailles in 1919 was seen

Nazism and WW2. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">But learning by the mistake the allies
would only accept unconditional surrender to end WW2 and instead of having a
treaty to make Germany pay the Marshall Plan was formed to help rebuild
Germany. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The church today is weak because we try to
bring people to Christ without bringing them to the point of unconditional
surrender.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Jesus took the Rich man down the road of
works.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Jesus showed him the one good thing that
he should do. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">He deals with the issue of trusting riches
and the laws requirement to love your neighbour as yourself in regard to
giving to the poor.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">No matter how much you give to the poor,
there will still be more poor.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">But in regard to the poor, how can you ever

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The rich man is following after <span class="SpellE">agathos</span> to inherit eternal life. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Jesus says do this good thing - </span><span lang="EN-GB">sell everything you have and
give it away to the poor.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Robertson
states that the Rich Young Ruler "Went away grieved." He felt that
Jesus had asked too much of him. He worshipped money more than God when put to the
test. Does Jesus demand this same test of every one? Not unless he is in the
grip of money. Different persons are in the power of different sins. One sin is enough to keep one away from
Christ. (see Online Bible)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">This misses the point.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The mans riches was not the issue.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The issue is <span class="SpellE">agathos</span>
what good thing must I do to inherit eternal life.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The good thing is love your poor
neighbour.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">There are only two ways to love your poor
neighbour and for your conscience to know you did all that was possible.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><span>1.</span></span><span lang="EN-GB">To give until world poverty has come to an end,or</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><span>2.</span></span><span lang="EN-GB">Give all away so you become poor yourself.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">No. 1 is impossible so No. 2 was the only
option.</span></p>
<p>The end of the road of good works is no nearer eternal life
 than at the start.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">What good thing must I do? Well if you
want to walk down the road of doing good to inherit eternal life then this is
as far as the road can go - sell all your property, everything that you have
and give to the poor.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It is a wonderful truth that earthly riches
can be used in this life to gain an eternal inheritance when it is given with a
good (<span class="SpellE">agathos</span>) heart filled with the love (agape) of
Christ. But giving all away is not
enough to inherit eternal life.</span></p>

the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it
profits me nothing.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Riches can not bring eternal life, but
riches can stop a person inheriting eternal life.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">He went away sorrowful because he had much
riches. He was unable to do this good
thing but even this good thing could not have saved him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Jesus was showing him how far the road of
works went sell all that you have and give to the poor this is the good
thing.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">But from this road of spiritual bankruptcy
there was a way to inherit eternal life. Jesus says to him then come and follow me.</span></p>
<p><b>3. Follow Me:</b></p>
<p>It is not by
following <span class="SpellE">agathos</span> that we inherit eternal
life. It is by following Christ that we
