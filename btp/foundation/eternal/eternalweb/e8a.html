He saith</span> unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona</span>: for flesh and blood hath not revealed <i>it</i> unto thee, but my Father, which is in heaven. And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter (petros</span>), and upon this rock (petra</span>) I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it."</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>b)</strong> The Foundation of the Church is "</span>Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the Living God<span class="italic text-gray-600">".</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The foundation is not Peter - "</span>Peter<span class="italic text-gray-600">" (Greek: petros meaning a stone);
