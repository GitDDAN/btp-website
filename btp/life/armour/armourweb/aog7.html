And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <i>be</i> with you. Amen."</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"> <span dir="LTR">The Gospel of peace sets us free to serve one another.<span> We can rest in being who we are in Christ.</span>The greatest in God's kingdom is the one who serves most, John 13.<span> This is how the body of Christ should function. We are labourers together in Christ. <span class="italic text-gray-600">"Let all your things be done with charity (1 Corinthians</span><st1:time hour="16" minute="13">16:13</st1:time>).</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>d)</strong> <span dir="LTR">The devil seeks to divide the body of Christ through competitiveness.<span> The body of Christ is not hierarchical or competitive, 1 Corinthians 13. Ministers of the Gospel are not in competition with one another. Those who seek to be highly honoured on earth will not be highly honoured in heaven.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>3"> <span dir="LTR">The Gospel of peace enables us to stand firm when the devil attacks us in our daily lives.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The peace of God will be our daily guide.<span> Colossians</span><st1:time hour="3" minute="15">3:15</st1:time>,<span> "</span>And</span> let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also you are called in one body; and be thankful.<span class="italic text-gray-600">"<span> The word rule is the Greek word <i>"</span>brabeuo<span class="italic text-gray-600">"</i> which</span> means "</span>to be the umpire<span class="italic text-gray-600">". The peace of Christ will enable us to stand firm with confidence in every circumstance.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The peace of God is closely associated with being filled with the word of God.Colossians 3:16<span> "</span>Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.<span class="italic text-gray-600">"</span>When we love Gods Word we will know His peace in all circumstances.Psalm 119:165, Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>a)</strong> <span dir="LTR">The peace of God will guard and keep us.</span>Philippians 4:6-7 <span class="italic text-gray-600">"Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.<span> And the peace of God, which passes all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus."</span><span> The peace of God will keep our hearts and minds. Stress will cause heart attacks and mental breakdowns, but the armour of God will keep us from the attacks of the enemy. The peace of God is sufficient for us to be at peace in all circumstances. Anxiety in believers is evidence that he or she has not learnt to put on the armour of God against the attacks of the enemy. Isaiah 26:3, Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusts in You.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>b)</strong> <span dir="LTR">The shoes of the preparation of the Gospel of peace. Prepared means readiness, the preparation of the Gospel of peace (Ephesians</span><st1:time hour="6" minute="15">6:15</st1:time>). The Christian must be prepared at all times against the attacks of the devil in our daily lives.<span> We must be equipped with the shoes of the Gospel of peace. If our feet are not firm then the enemy will be able to pull us down because we are not ready for his attacks.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>> <span dir="LTR">Facing death.<span> Peter slept in the face of death in prison, Acts 12:6. John Wesley said that even the enemies had to agree We Christians die well. John Wesleys dying words were The best of all is, God is with us. Perfect peace in the face of death.
