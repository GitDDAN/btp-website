The ministry of serving one another must always be born out of love for Christ.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>&gt; Purpose of ministry - The true worshipper seeks the glory of God in every action.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"&gt; Goal of ministry - Ministry is an act of worship when it is directed towards the goal of "</span>winning Christ<span class="italic text-gray-600">".</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Introductory Story:</b>Ministry can be compared to running a race</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>&gt; Running towards the goal of a successful ministry - forgetting those things that are behind means serving the Lord and not giving the heart to the things of the world.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"&gt; The restraining power of the word of God. "</span>Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.<span class="italic text-gray-600">" Philippians 2:3.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>&gt; The love for the scriptures does not automatically produce love in the heart.<span> Standing for God<span class="italic text-gray-600">'s word does not change lives. The word of God must change us. A negative unity with those who agree with each other's criticisms is not the unity of the Spirit.</span></span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"&gt; The trial of our faith makes the ministry difficult."</span>That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perishes, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:<span class="italic text-gray-600">" (1 Peter 1:7).God is producing character.The greatest worship comes out of the greatest trial, "</span>My grace is sufficient for you: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.<span class="italic text-gray-600">"<span> (2 Corinthians 12:9).</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>&gt; The joy of pleasing Him.<span> <span class="italic text-gray-600">"Forget those things which are behind"</span> now means forgetting self glory by seeking <span class="italic text-gray-600">"the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus"</span>.</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Exposition:</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>1.</strong> A worshipper must run towards the right goal.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>&gt; The word converted in Greek is epistrepho, this word literally means to turn towards.<span class="italic text-gray-600">"And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:<span> But I have prayed for you, that your faith fail not: and when you are converted, strengthen thy brethren."</span> (Luke 22:31-32).</span>Why did Simon Peter need to be turned around?<span> Up until this time he was running towards the goal of a successful ministry. All the disciples saw their relationship with Jesus as an opportunity to achieve greatness.</span><span class="italic text-gray-600">"And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest."</span> (Luke 22:24)The Lord allowed Peter to be sifted in order to remove the chaff of self glory from the wheat of love for Christ.<span> Peter sought to become great through a successful ministry. Peter was competitive and ambitious. Part of a ministry team, but it was not the love of Christ that motivated him. Peter<span class="italic text-gray-600">'s self confidence had to be broken before he could fulfil the ministry the Lord had called him to do. Peter regarded himself as better than all the other disciples when he said, "</span>Although all shall be offended, yet not I (Mark 14:29). Peter had to be turned around before He could minister in the anointing</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"&gt; All the disciples had their sights on success but only Judas could not be turned towards the right goal.<span> They had very big ambitions for their ministries, and they sought to use their relationship with Jesus to gain a position where they would be highly esteemed. Satan was able to destroy Judas because Judas did not love Christ. The disciples all ran towards success, but only Judas followed Christ for gain. The other disciples were not like Judas. It was therefore impossible for Satan to destroy them; he could only sift them. Satan cannot do anything without God's permission.</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>2.</strong> A worshipper must be a disciple, learning to be like Jesus.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>&gt; The Greek word <span class="italic text-gray-600">"mathetes"</span> which is translated disciple means <span class="italic text-gray-600">"a learner"</span>.<span> Disciples of Christ learn to rest in the Father<span class="italic text-gray-600">'s will. The disciples were learning Christ. They still had to learn the real nature of ministry. All of Peter's ambitions concerning a successful ministry died when Jesus was crucified. He thought everything was lost, but he was learning to be like Jesus who came not to fulfil His own ambitions, but to obey the Father<span class="italic text-gray-600">'s will.</span></span></span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>&gt; Jesus showed them by example at the Last Supper that those who would be great in God<span class="italic text-gray-600">'s Kingdom must take the place of a servant.</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>3.</strong> A worshipper must always be motivated by the love of Christ.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"&gt; If we are motivated by love for Christ then we will look upon others as better than ourselves.<span> If we are motivated by personal ambitions then we will seek to use others to elevate ourselves. The road to a successful ministry is dependent upon having good connections.</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>&gt; The minister who has been turned around seeks not a successful ministry, but to please the Lord.<span> Look at Peter in prison sleeping, without concern. Herod had already executed James the brother of John, and it was certain that he would put Peter to death the same way.</span><span class="italic text-gray-600">"Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him.<span> And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison."</span> (Acts 12:5-6).</span>The Lord had told Peter he would be in this position when he was old.<span> He was not yet old, and Peter rested in the will of God. This was not a man seeking to build up his own ministry. He had no fear of death, and he had no ambitions of his own.</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Conclusion:</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Ministry must be</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>1.</strong> to win Christ.<span> The worshipper must run towards the right goal.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>2.</strong> to be like Christ.<span> The worshipper must be a disciple, learning to be like Jesus.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>3.</strong> driven by love for Christ.<span> A worshipper must always be motivated by the love of Christ.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>What should the student do?</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>1)</strong> Check that we are not seeking our own glory in ministry.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>2)</strong> Be a disciple learning to be more like Jesus.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>3)</strong> Let the love of Christ be our motivation in all things.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b><a href="/courses/christian-life/worship/lesson-9.html">Lesson Outline</a></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b><a href="/courses/christian-life/worship/part-1.html">Course Index</a></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b><a href="/courses/christian-life/worship.html">Textbook</a></b><span> - The Higher Calling to Worship</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p>
