                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Isaac Sharp (1806-1897) and Asbjrn Kloster (1823-1876)</h3>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Isaac Sharp and Asbjrn Kloster were members of 'The Society of Friends' better known as 'Quakers'.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Isaac Sharp was a minister and preacher who in the later years of his life travelled around the world. His story is told in the book 'Isaac Sharp Apostle of the 19th century' written by Frances Anne Budge (1898)</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Asbjrn Kloster is known for his work with the total abstinance society which he founded in Stavangar in 1859. A statue in Stavangar commemorates his work with the society.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Early Quakers and their beliefs.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Followers of George Fox (1624-1691)</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Upheld the authority of scripture</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Believed in inner light.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Necessary to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Opposed the paying of tithes; giving of titles; rejected religious rituals including the need for water baptism; maintained that God dwells in people not in buildings..</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Would not swear oaths.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">George Fox is buried in the graveyard at Bunhill Fields, London.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Quakerism today</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">19th century shift away from Evangelicalism focusing on social concerns.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">General position now is that it no longer upholds the authority of scripture.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Maintains emphasis upon the inner voice.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">First visit toFaroes(1861)</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Isaac Sharp first visited theFaroeIslands withAsbjornKlosterin 1861.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">They sailed fromGrangemouthtoTorshavn.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Onboard ship was the minister of the church fromSandurwho they met again on April 25th, 1862.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Isaac Sharp mentions in his journal April 24th, 1862 that they used theThingHouse (Parliament house) inTorshavnfor a Sunday meeting on their first visit.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">ISAAC SHARPS VISIT TO THE FAROE ISLANDS(April June 1862).</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Method of meeting.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Isaac Sharp andAsbjornKlosterdid not plan their meetings.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">They arranged the meetings without making any program.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">They gathered together in silence.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Then the meeting would proceed as the Holy Spirit led.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">They would let the Holy Spirit direct their thoughts.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">If it was right to speak they did so.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">They waited for guidance to speak on the right message.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Sometimes they felt great freedom where the Lord owned the meeting.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Other times there was a heaviness that made the meeting difficult.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Place of meetings</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Meetings mostly took place in the large room in the house called theRogstue(Danish) orRoykstova(Faroese).</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">InTorshavnmeetings took place in theThingHouse (Hall of Justice).</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">InEidia meeting took place in a new warehouse.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">On occasions a meeting took place in the Lutheran Church.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Expenses.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The expenses for the mission to Faroes were covered by 'The Society of Friends' under 'The Yearly Meeting Fund' (formerly National Stock) and central funds.Collections of money for the service of truth, at first for support of travelling ministers, and for printing, were made up and down the country in the 1650s; the Kendal Fund is the best known of these.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The cost of the mission can be found in the ledger. Two payments were made to Isaac Sharp. One for 100 which was given prior to departure and one later payment of over 11-13s 11d. Therefore we can presume the entire cost amounted to 111-13s 11d.</p>
