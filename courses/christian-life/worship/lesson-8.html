Just before she went through the security check she turned and the smile of excitement on her face was worth far more to me than hearing her say thanks. But with God this is never the case. The joy in our hearts is not enough. We need also to give thanks.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">I thought why does God not see my joy as sufficient?<span> As I meditated on this it became obvious. Thanksgiving and praise is centred upon God and not me. Giving thanks takes the attention away from the benefits that I have received, and puts all the attention upon the goodness of God. When we enter into worship we must put all our attention upon the goodness and greatness of God.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Exposition:</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>1.</strong> The cares of life must be left behind in worship.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>&gt; The cares of life can take our attention away from the Lord and stop us from being worshippers.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"&gt; Difficult situations become opportunities to worship. <span>We must be free from worry.</span>"</span>Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.<span> And the peace of God, which passes all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.<span class="italic text-gray-600">" (Philippians 4:6-7)</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>&gt; Illustration:<span> Limitations of the brain.</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Our brain enables us to think great thoughts, but it is also very limited in what it can do.<span> If we direct all our concentration onto a particular thing then it is difficult to think about something else at the same time. Very intelligent people are often known for neglecting their personal appearance. The great professor of modern science may be able to unravel the mysteries of science and yet be completely unaware that his hair is a total mess or his shirt is buttoned wrongly.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>This inability to think on many things at the same time is a great blessing in worship. God tells us to give thanks in everything and for everything. When we are giving thanks it is difficult to think about the difficulties of life that would pull us down. Thanksgiving lifts us above the situations and the problems that we face. The problem is still there, but now our thoughts are higher.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>2.</strong> The concerns of life must also be left behind</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>&gt; It is often not bad things that stop us from being worshippers; family affairs, business affairs, or everyday things.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"&gt; The ten lepers, all were healed, all had something to rejoice about, but only one became a worshipper, Luke 17:12-19.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>&gt; True unity in the Spirit is a unity built on who we are in Christ.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"&gt; The Samaritan had become a worshipper.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>3.</strong> Pride will stop us from becoming worshippers</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"&gt; The pride of life will take our attention away from the Lord and stop us from becoming worshippers.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>&gt; We need to be like the children who offered praise to the Lord in the temple, Matthew 21:15-17.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"&gt; Humility is essential in worship, 1 Peter 5:5-6.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Conclusion:</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The worshipper enters into worship with thanksgiving and praise.<span> For the worshipper</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>1.</strong> The cares of life will become opportunities for worship.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>2.</strong> The concerns of life become unimportant in comparison to knowing Christ.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>3.</strong> The childlike character of humility will leads us to worship the Lord.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b><a href="lesson-7.html">Lesson Outline</a></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b><a href="/courses/christian-life/worship/part-1.html">Course Index</a></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b><a href="/courses/christian-life/worship.html">Textbook</a></b><span> - The Higher Calling to Worship</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p>
