<p><b>Lesson Ten</b></p>
<p><b>Title:</b>The Sword of the Spirit</p>
Ephesians
6:17
Using the Word of God to repel the enemy and to advance. 
<p><b>Details concerning
the Roman sword:</b></p>
<p>1.A short stabbing sword. </p>
<p>2.Size of Blade: approx. 54 cm long (21 inches; 6.4cm width near the hilt
(2½ inches)</p>
<p>3.Sharp pointed</p>
<p>4.Two edges</p>
<p>5.Designed for close combat</p>
<p>6.Best used by a trained and skilled soldier</p>
<p>7.Deadly</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The
Gladiator </p>
<p>The sword was called 'gladius' in Latin.</p>
<p>The name gladiator comes from the word gladius.</p>
<p>Gladiator - swordsman (one who uses a gladius) </p>
<p>The Gladiator was a professional fighter who fought in the arenas of
ancient Rome.</p>
<p>Gladiators came from prisoners of war and slaves, but sometimes Romans
became gladiators to gain wealth.</p>
<p>Gladiators fought each other; and sometimes they fought wild animals or
condemned criminals.</p>
<p><b>Illustration:The Turned Thumb</b></p>
<p><b>Applause of the Arena</b></p>
<p>The skill of the Gladiator was applauded by the crowds of the Roman
arena.</p>
<p>A Gladiator did not always wear full armour</p>
<p><b>The Crowd Decides</b></p>
<p>It is thought the crowd would decide if the defeated gladiator should
live or die.</p>
<p>If the thumb was turned down then it may have meant - let him live
(lower your weapon).</p>
<p>If the thumb was turned up - let him die (to the throat).</p>
<p><b>The Christian Gladiator seeks to glorify Jesus in his or her life.</b><b></b></p>
<p>The skill of the Christian Gladiator is not for personal glory but to
glorify Jesus.</p>
<p>Every Christian should learn to be skilful with the Sword of the Spirit
in spiritual warfare so that Jesus will be glorified in us.</p>
<p>The Christian needs to put on the whole armour of God - the enemy will
easily defeat a Christian who uses the sword but doesn't put on the whole
panoply of God.</p>
<p><b>The judgement (bema) seat of Christ. </b></p>
<p>There will come a day when the skill of the Christian Gladiator will be
rewarded at the bema seat of Christ.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians 5:10. </p>
<h2>Main Points</h2>
<h3>1. The 'rhema' word of God</h3>
<p>The sword was taken from the belt.</p>
<p>The Sword of the Spirit must be taken from the Belt of Truth. </p>
<p>The Sword of the Spirit is the 'rhema' word of God.</p>
<p>The Belt of Truth is the 'logos' word of God.</p>
<p>The 'rhema' word of God is a word taken from the 'logos' belt of
truth.</p>
<p>The 'rhema' word of God' is the word that the Spirit brings to us for a
specific purpose. </p>
<p>The Holy Spirit enables us to use the Word of God at a particular time
and place.</p>
<p>Vines defines the Greek 'rhema' meaning word (Ephesians 6:17) as 'the individual scripture
which the Spirit brings to our remembrance for use in a time of need'.Luke 1:37 'For no word (rhema)
from God shall be void of power', (ASV).</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> </p>
<p><span>The Temptation of
Jesus:Jesus used the Sword of the Spirit
when He was tempted by the devil.<b></b></span></p>
<p>The devil attacked
using scripture, Matthew 4:3,6.Jesus answered with Sword of the Spirit, Matthew
4:4,7, 'it is written...'.</p>
<h3>2. Discipleship</h3>
<p>The sword had to be used by the hand of skilful soldier.</p>
<p>The Roman soldier was trained to be skilful in the use of the
sword.</p>
<p><b>Using the sword.</b></p>
<p>•Positioning
- Finding the best position to fight.</p>
<p>•Skilled
- It is dangerous for a novice to fight with the sword.A skilful soldier will easily defeat
him.The sword can be far superior to
the enemies but if the soldier is not trained he or she will soon be defeated.</p>
<p>•Experience
- Handling the sword of the Spirit requires both skill and experience.</p>
<p><b>The Sword of the Spirit must be used skilfully.</b></p>
<p>It is necessary to be discipled in the use of the word of God.</p>
<p>It requires learning to be skilful but also it requires experience.</p>
<p>Young soldiers could learn from experienced soldiers. </p>
<p>Disciple is the
Greek word 'mathetes' meaning 'a learner'.</p>
<p>Knowledge of the
scriptures is essential in using the Sword of the Spirit</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Learning to know scripture so that the Word of Christ is in our thoughts
continuously,Colossians 4:16; Ephesians
5:19; Psalms 19:14.</p>
<p>If we do not know the scriptures then we cannot use the Sword
effectively.</p>
<p>-</p>
<h3>3. The sword was a powerful
weapon.It was a pointed two edged
sword.</h3>
<p><b>The Method</b></p>
<p>The sword had to be thrust into the enemy.</p>
<p>a)Watch carefully</p>
<p>b)Guard for attack</p>
<p>c)Move to attack</p>
<p><span>d)Thrust the sword<b></b></span></p>
<p><span>The Roman soldier could thrust the sword in such a way that the weapon
was deadly to the enemy.<b></b></span><b></b></p>
<p><span>The thrust -taking hold of the
promises of God and thrusting with the 'rhema' word of God.<b> </b></span><b></b></p>
<p><b>Illustration:</b>The Thrust</p>
<p>Here is a quote from 'The whole armour of God'
by P.N.Correy (1931)</p>
<p>'The Roman warrior had but one method of using
his short sword, and that was the thrust.</p>
<p>The Romans paid special attention to the
training of their legions in swordsmanship, and the effective use of the point
was a mark of their advanced skill.For
this the double-edged sword of Roman pattern stands out as a workmanlike and
formidable weapon for a close fight, in which the point was always used by preference.</p>
<p>You are not called to dance around, playing
and dallying with the enemy, but to break through his guard and destroy him
with the thrust of your weapon.'</p>
<p><b>The sword's deadly
character</b></p>
<p><b>a)</b><b>Two edged</b></p>
<p>The Roman sword was
a two edged sword.</p>
<p>The double-edge of
the sword made it difficult for the enemy to stand against it.</p>
<p><b>b)</b><b>Pointed</b></p>
<p>The Roman sword was
pointed.</p>
<p>The point of the
sword was deadly when used skilfully.</p>
<p>The Roman soldier became skilful in thrusting the sword. </p>
<p><b>The Sword of the Spirit is
used in the same way.</b></p>
<p><b>a)</b><b>The
Sword is a two edged sword.</b></p>
<p>Both sides of the
blade will cut through the enemy. </p>
<p>Every other part of the armour is defensive, but the sword is both defensive
and offensive.</p>
<p>The sword needed to be used both defensively - stopping the attacks of
the enemy and offensively - attacking the enemy.</p>
<p><b>b)</b><b>Pointed
Sword</b></p>
<p>When the enemy
attacks, thrust the pointed sword of the rhema word of God.</p>
<p><span>The sword of the
Spirit is able to defeat every attack of the enemy.<b></b></span></p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Fear
is attacked by the thrust of faith, which means to firmly trust the promises of
God in a difficult situation.</p>
<p>'No weapon that is
formed against you shall prosper' (Isaiah 54:17).</p>
<p><b>The Sword of the
Spirit is not to be used to attack each other. </b></p>
<p>Quoting scriptures
against one another. </p>
<p>This is using the
sword like a dagger to stab other Christians in the back.Paul makes no mention of a dagger in
Christian armour.</p>
<p><b>The Sword of the Spirit
should be used to protect others.</b></p>
<p>The sword is both for fighting individually
and
for protecting each other.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> </p>
<p>A 'rhema' word is
able to lift a person out of depression or discouragement.</p>
<p>It is a word from
the Spirit that brings deliverance and joy.</p>
<h3>4. The </h3>
<p><b>Sword is the 'Sword of
the Spirit'</b></p>
<p>When the Roman
soldier fought 'hand to hand' he could only rely upon his own skill and the
backup of other soldiers.</p>
<p>The Christian
soldier has another Helper; the Holy Spirit.The Sword is called the Sword of the Spirit (Ephesians 6:17), and only
the Holy Spirit can make the Christian victorious in spiritual warfare. </p>
<p><b>The power of the
Holy Spirit and the authority of the word of God.</b></p>
<p>Using the scriptures
without the Holy Spirit has no power. </p>
<p>Quoting scriptures
alone does not defeat the enemy. </p>
<p><b>The Holy Spirit and
the Word of God</b></p>
<p>Attempting to move
in the power of the Holy Spirit without the word of God has no authority.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Truth, John
16:13.</p>
<p><b>Trusting in the
promises of God.</b></p>
<p>We need to know the
scriptures, and to keep the scriptures continuously upon our heart.</p>
<p>So that when the trial
comes we can take up the sword of the Spirit.</p>
<p><span>Hebrews 13:6 ¶ 'So that
we may boldly <b>say</b>, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man
shall do unto me.' </span></p>
<p><b>Faith comes through the
preaching of the 'rhema' word of God.</b></p>
<p><span>Romans 10:17'So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the <b>word (rhema) </b>of
God.'</span></p>
<p><b>Preaching and
Teaching</b></p>
<p>Preaching is using the 'sword of the Spirit', the rhema word of God,to break through barriers andstrongholds that keep people bound.</p>
<p>Teaching is presenting the word of God(logos) to equip God's people.</p>
<p>Preaching is the battlefield. </p>
<p>Teaching is the Academy.</p>
<p><b>Salvation comes through the preaching of the 'rhema' word
of God</b></p>
<p>Word of faith is preached</p>
<p>With the heart we believe.</p>
<p>With our words we make outward confession of our
faith </p>
<p><span>Romans 10:8-10' ... The <b>word (rhema) </b>is near you, even in your mouth, and in
your heart: that is, the <b>word (rhema) </b>of faith, which we preach; That if
you shall confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in your
heart that God has raised him from the dead, you shall be saved. For with the
heart man believes unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made
unto salvation.</span></p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>1The Sword of
the Spirit is the rhema word of God.It
is the word given to us by the Holy Spirit for a specific purpose.</p>
<p>2It requires
discipleship.The soldier must be
trained to use the sword skilfully.</p>
<p>3The sword was
a powerful weapon.It was a pointed two
edged sword. Deadly to the enemy.</p>
<p>4The sword is the 'sword of the Spirit'.The Holy Spirit empowers the word the word on
our heart so that we can speak with boldness.</p>
