The sacrament was not only regarded as symbolic but that it also contained the grace it signified (ex opera operato).</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">See the Council of Trent 1547 (7<sup>th</sup> Session) 7 sacraments contain the grace they signify.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>a.&gt; The Real Presence - The Eucharist.<span> New Testament in remembrance of me 1 Corinthians 11.

Those, therefore, who speak against this gift of God, incur death in the midst of their disputes. But it were better for them to treat it with respect, [1018] that they also might rise again. It is fitting, therefore, that ye should keep aloof from such persons, and not to speak of them either in private or in public, but to give heed to the prophets, and above all, to the Gospel, in which the passion [of Christ] has been revealed to us, and the resurrection has been fully proved. But avoid all divisions, as the beginning of evils.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">(Ignatius - Epistle to <st1:city><st1:place>Smyrna</st1:place></st1:city> Chapter 7).</p> <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-4" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal">By claiming the Real Presence of Christ was in the Eucharist, the position of the Bishop could be elevated as the only lawful administrator of the sacrament.</li> </ul> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Ignatius associated the Eucharist with the office of the Bishop</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">See that ye all follow the bishop, even as Jesus Christ does the Father, and the presbytery as ye would the apostles; and reverence the deacons, as being the institution of God. Let no man do anything connected with the Church without the bishop. Let that be deemed a proper Eucharist, which is [administered] either by the bishop, or by one to whom he has entrusted it.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Wherever the bishop shall appear, there let the multitude [of the people] also be; even as, wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church. It is not lawful without the bishop either to baptize or to celebrate a love-feast; but whatsoever he shall approve of, that is also pleasing to God, so that everything that is done may be secure and valid.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">(Ignatius - Epistle to <st1:city><st1:place>Smyrna</st1:place></st1:city> Chapter 8).</p> <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-4" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal">The sacrament of the Eucharist soon became a re-enactment of <st1:place>Calvary</st1:place>.<span> The priest offered Christ as a sacrifice.

He explains that the substance of the bread and wine is changed when consecrated by the priest, but the outward properties remain.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Thomas Aquinas is to the doctrine of the Mass what <st1:city><st1:place>Darwin</st1:place></st1:city> is to the theory of Evolution.<span> He did not invent the theory but he gave an explanation of how it worked.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Note:<span> Even if the bread and wine did become the literal body of Christ there would be no benefit in eating it except in remembering the finished work of Christ.

Give public instruction on all these points, and then "baptize" in running water, "in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." <sup>2</sup> If you do not have running water, baptize in some other.<sup>3</sup> If you cannot in cold, then in warm. If you have neither, then pour water on the head three times "in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit." <sup>4</sup> Before the baptism, moreover, the one who baptizes and the one being baptized must fast, and any others who can. And you must tell the one being baptized to fast for one or two days beforehand.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>3.</strong> The development of monasteries.<span> Jesus said Let your light so shine that they may see your good works.

This man, endeavoring to realize in the flesh the existence of the heavenly hosts, lifts himself above the concerns of earth, and overpowering the downward tendency of man's nature, is intent on things above. He was adored by all the countryside, wrought many miracles, and the Emperor Theodosius II listened to his advice and sought his benediction.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Simeon prolonged his endurance of this mode of life through fifty-six years; nine of which he spent in the first monastery where he was instructed in divine knowledge, and forty-seven in the "Mandra" as it was called; namely, ten in a certain nook; on shorter columns, seven; and thirty upon one of forty cubits. After his departure [from this life] his holy body was conveyed to Antioch, escorted by the garrison, and a great concourse guarding the venerable body, lest the inhabitants of the neighboring cities should gather and carry it off. In this manner it was conveyed to <st1:city><st1:place>Antioch</st1:place></st1:city>, and attended, during its progress, with extraordinary prodigies.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The body has been preserved nearly entire until my time [about 580 A.D.]; and in company with many priests, I enjoyed a sight of his sacred head, in the episcopate of the famous Gregory, when Philippicus had requested that precious relic of the saints might be sent him for the protection of the Eastern armies. The head was well preserved save for the teeth some of which had been violently removed by the hands of the pious [for relics].</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">According to another writer, Theodoret, in Simeon's lifetime, he was visited by pilgrims from near and far; <st1:country-region><st1:place>Persia</st1:place></st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Ethiopia</st1:place></st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Spain</st1:place></st1:country-region>, and even <st1:country-region><st1:place>Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region>. To these at times he delivered sermons. He wore on his body a heavy iron chain. In praying, "he bent his body so that his forehead almost touched his feet." A spectator once counted 1244 repetitions of this movement, and then gave up reckoning. Simeon took only one scanty meal per week, and fasted through the season of Lent. It is alleged that the devil having afflicted him with an ulcer in his thigh as reward for a little self-righteousness, Simeon, as penance, never touched the afflicted leg upon the pillar again, and stood for the remaining year of his life upon one leg.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>Source.</strong></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">From: William Stearns Davis, ed., <i>Readings in Ancient History: Illustrative Extracts from the Sources, </i>2 Vols.

Development of Monasticism. (Schaff)</span></i></span></p> <p class="p3 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="s1"><span>In the historical development of the monastic institution we must distinguish four stages. The first three were completed in the fourth century; the remaining one reached maturity in the Latin church of the middle age.</span></span></p> <p class="p3 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="s1"><span>The first stage is an ascetic life as yet not organized nor separated from the church. It comes down from the ante-Nicene age, and has been already noticed. It now took the form, for the most part, of either hermit or coenobite life, but continued in the church itself, especially among the clergy, who might be called half monks.</span></span></p> <p class="p3 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="s1"><span>The second stage is hermit life or anchoretism. It arose in the beginning of the fourth century, gave asceticism a fixed and permanent shape, and pushed it to even external separation from the world. It took the prophets Elijah and John the Baptist for its models, and went beyond them. Not content with partial and temporary retirement from common life, which may be united with social intercourse and useful labors, the consistent anchoret secludes himself from all society, even from kindred ascetics, and comes only exceptionally into contact with human affairs, either to receive the visits of admirers of every class, especially of the sick and the needy (which were very frequent in the case of the more celebrated monks), or to appear in the cities on some extraordinary occasion, as a spirit from another world. His clothing is a hair shirt and a wild beasts skin; his food, bread and salt; his dwelling, a cave; his employment, prayer, affliction of the body, and conflict with satanic powers and wild images of fancy. This mode of life was founded by Paul of Thebes and St. Anthony, and came to perfection in the East. It was too eccentric and unpractical for the West, and hence less frequent there, especially in the rougher climates. To the female sex it was entirely unsuited. There was a class of hermits, the Sarabaites in</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="s1"><span>Egypt</span></span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class="s1"><span>, and the Rhemoboths in</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="s1"><span>Syria</span></span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class="s1"><span>, who lived in bands of at least two or three together; but their quarrelsomeness, occasional intemperance, and opposition to the clergy, brought them into ill repute.</span></span></span></span></p> <p class="p3 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="s1"><span>The third step in the progress of the monastic life brings us to coenobitism or cloister life, monasticism in the ordinary sense of the word. It originated likewise in</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="s1"><span>Egypt</span></span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class="s1"><span>, from the example of the Essenes and Therapeutae, and was carried by</span><st1:place><span class="s1"><span>St.</span></span></st1:place><span class="s1"><span> Pachomius to the East, and afterward by St. Benedict to the West. Both these ascetics, like the most celebrated order-founders of later days, were originally hermits. Cloister life is a regular organization of the ascetic life on a social basis. It recognizes, at least in a measure, the social element of human nature, and represents it in a narrower sphere secluded from the larger world. As hermit life often led to cloister life, so the cloister life was not only a refuge for the spirit weary of the world, but also in many ways a school for practical life in the church. It formed the transition from isolated to social Christianity. It consists in an association of a number of anchorets of the same sex for mutual advancement in ascetic holiness. The coenobites live, somewhat according to the laws of civilization, under one roof, and under a superintendent or abbot. They divide their time between common devotions and manual labor, and devote their surplus provisions to charity; except the mendicant monks, who themselves live by alms. In this modified form monasticism became available to the female sex, to which the solitary desert life was utterly impracticable; and with the cloisters of monks, there appear at once cloisters also of nuns. Between the anchorets and the coenobites no little jealousy reigned; the former charging the latter with ease and conformity to the world; the latter accusing the former of selfishness and misanthropy. The most eminent church teachers generally prefer the cloister life. But the hermits, though their numbers diminished, never became extinct. Many a monk was a hermit first, and then a coenobite; and many a coenobite turned to a hermit.</span></span></span></span></p> <p class="p3 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="s1"><span>The same social impulse, finally, which produced monastic congregations, led afterward to monastic orders, unions of a number of cloisters under one rule and a common government. In this fourth and last stage monasticism has done most for the diffusion of Christianity and the advancement of learning, has fulfilled its practical mission in the Roman Catholic church, and still wields a mighty influence there. At the same time it became in some sense the cradle of the German reformation. Luther belonged to the order of</span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="s1"><span>St. Augustine</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="s1"><span>, and the monastic discipline of</span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="s1"><span>Erfurt</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="s1"><span> was to him a preparation for evangelical freedom, as the Mosaic law was to Paul a schoolmaster to lead to Christ. And for this very reason Protestantism is the end of the monastic life.</span></span></span></span></p>
