<p class="Mso Normal"><span lang="EN-GB"><span><b>1.</b></span></span><span><span lang="EN-GB">The Blood of the Covenant.</span></span></p>
<p>The foundation of
the covenant is the shedding of blood.</p>
<p>The Old Covenant
was maintained by the killing of animals for sacrifice.</p>
<p>When God made a
covenant with Abraham the pieces of the dead animals were placed in a figure of
eight.</p>
<p>Abraham believed
God and it was counted to him as righteousness.<span lang="EN-GB"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref">Genesis
15:6</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>The need for a blood sacrifice and faith in God's covenant.</p>
<p class="Mso Normal"><span lang="EN-GB">Hebrews </span><span lang="EN-GB">9:22</span><span lang="EN-GB">'And almost all things are by the law purged
with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.'</span></p>
<br/>
<p>The need for a blood sacrifice and faith in God's covenant is seen throughout the Old Testament beginning with the sacrifice of Abel</p>
<p>Abel brought a blood sacrifice (<span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref">Genesis 4:4</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>).</p>
<p>Abel's sacrifice was offered in faith.</p>

<p class="Mso Normal"><span lang="EN-GB"><span><b>2.</b></span></span><span><span lang="EN-GB">The Partakers of the Covenant.</span></span></p>
<p>God moved through the pieces as a 'burning lamp' to make a covenant
with Abram.</p>
<p>God gave all that He is to Abram.</p>
<p>God became Abram's blood covenant Brother.</p>
<p>In return Abram gave himself to God.</p>
<p>This was not a covenant between equals.</p>
<p>Abram slept.</p>
<p>God was the initiator and the completer of the
covenant.</p>

<p>The name of God YHVH - Yahveh probably pronounced by 'breathing
out-ah'. The name Abram becomes Abraham
'breathing out - ah'.</p>
<p>The name of Sarai becomes Sarah 'breathing out -ah'.</p>
