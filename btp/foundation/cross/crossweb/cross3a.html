<p class="Mso Normal"><b><span lang="EN-GB">Main Points:</span></b></p>
<p class="Mso Normal"><span lang="EN-GB"><span><b>1.</b></span></span><span><span lang="EN-GB">The problem of sin - it is incurable.</span></span></p>
<p>We are born dead in sin, <span><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref">Ephesians 2:1</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>.</span></p>
<p class="Mso Normal"><span lang="EN-GB">Sin is like a
poison in the bloodstream. Sinful is
inherent in our nature. There is no cure
for the sinful nature.</span></p>
<br/>
<p>Psychology cannot cure the sinful nature. Psychology seeks to change behaviour - it
cannot change the heart.</p>
<br/>
<p>Good works cannot remove sin. Our righteousness is like filthy rags, <span><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref">Isaiah 64:6</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>.</span> Jesus rebuked the Pharisees because they did
everything to be seen of men. On the
outside they appeared to uphold high morals but on the inside they were
'unclean'.</p>
<br/>
<p>Religion has no power to remove sin. The sacraments have no power to save. Communion and Baptism are outward actions that cannot change the heart.</p>
<br/>
<p>All people are on the same level. Sin is against the holiness of God. The sinful thoughts of a caring mother or the evil intent of a murderer
stand in rebellion against the righteousness of God.</p>
