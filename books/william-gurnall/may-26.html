<p class="Default"><span class="GramE"><b><span>The Inward Principle of Prayer.</span></b></span><b></b></p>
<br/>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span class="GramE"><span>'In the Spirit.<span>'</span></span></span></p>
<br/>
<p class="Default"><b><span>[To pray in the spirit, we
must have FERVENCY.] </span></b></p>
<p class="Default"><span class="GramE"><b><span>[Arguments to enkindle our zeal and fervency in
prayer.]</span></b></span><b></b></p>
<p class="Default"><span class="GramE"><b><span>Argument 1.</span></b></span><span> Consider the <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">excellency</span></span>
of zeal and fervency. If a saint, you have a principle that inclines you to
approve of things that are excellent; and such is this. Life is the <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">excellency</span></span> of beings, yea, even in
inanimate creatures there is an analogical life, and therein consists its <span class="SpellE">excellency</span>. The spirits of wine commend it; what is it
worth when dead and flat? In the diamond, the sparkle gives the worth; in
fountain water, that which makes it more excellent than other is its motion,
called therefore 'living water.' Much more in beings that have true life; for
this the flea or fly are counted nobler creatures than the sun. The higher kind
of life that beings have, their nature is thereby the more advanced-beasts
above plants, men above beasts, and angels above men. Now as life gives the <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">excellency</span></span> to being, so vivacity
and vigour in operating gives <span class="SpellE">excellency</span> to life.
Indeed the nobler the life of the creature is<span class="GramE">,</span> the
greater energy is in its <span class="SpellE">actings</span>. The apprehension of
an angel is quicker, and zeal stronger, than in a man. So that, the more lively
you are in your duty, and the more zeal you express therein, the nearer you
come to the nature of those glorious spirits who, for their zeal in service of
God, are called 'a flame of fire.' I confess, to be calm and cool in inferior
things, and in our own matters between man and man, <span class="GramE">is</span>
better than zeal. So Solomon says, 'A man of understanding is of an excellent
spirit,' Proverbs 17:27. In the Hebrew it is a cool spirit. Injuries do not put
him into a <span class="GramE">flame,</span> neither do any occurrences in the
world heat him to any height of joy, grief, or anger. Who more temperate in
these than Moses? <span class="GramE">but</span> set this holy man to pray, he is
fire and tow, all life and zeal. Indeed it is one <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">excellency</span></span> of this fervency of spirit in prayer, that
it allays all sinful passions. David's fervency in praying for his child when <span class="GramE">alive,</span> made him bear the tidings of his death so calmly and
patiently. We hear not an angry word that Hannah replies to her scolding
companion <span class="SpellE">Peninnah</span>. <span class="GramE">And why, but
because she had found the art of easing her troubled spirit in prayer?</span>
What need she contend with her adversary, who could, by wrestling with God,
persuade him to espouse her quarrel? And truly were there nothing else to
commend fervency of spirit in prayer, this is enough-that, like David's harp,
it can charm the evil spirit of our passions, which in their excess the saint
counts great sins, and I am sure finds them grievous troubles. When are you
more placate and serene, than when the most life and fervour your souls can
mount up in the flame of your sacrifices into the bosom of God? Possibly you
may come, like Moses, down the mount with greater heat, but it will be against
sin, not for self; whereas a formal prayer, like a plaster, which has good
ingredients in it, yet being laid cold upon the wound, hurts it rather than
heals it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default"><span class="GramE"><b><span>Argument 2.</span></b></span><span> God deserves the prime and strength of your soul should be bestowed on
him in your prayers. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default"><span>(1.) He gave you the powers of
your soul and all your affections. According to the mould so is the statue that
is cast in it; such you are as you were in the idea of the divine mind. Now,
may not your Maker call for that which was his gift? He that made the stone an
inanimate being, and confined the narrow souls of brutes to act upon low
sensitive <span class="GramE">good</span>, ennobles you with a rational appetite
and spiritual affections. Now, will you not employ those divine powers in the worship
of your God, from whom, you had them? This were hard indeed-that God should be
denied what himself gave, and not suffered to taste of his own cost. 'I came
unto my own,' says Christ, 'and they would not receive me.' Thus here, I came
to my own creature; he had his life from me, and brings a dead heart unto me!
Suppose a friend should give you notice that he will ere long be at your house,
and sends you in beforehand a vessel of rich wine; which you, when he comes,
grudge to broach it for his entertainment, and put him off with that which is
dead and flat? Expect you a better friend to be your guest than your God? The
psalmist calls upon us to 'serve the Lord with gladness,' and what is his
enforcement? 'Know you that the Lord he is God: it is he that has made us,' Psalm 100:2, 3. <span class="GramE">Who</span> plants a vineyard and looks not to drink
of the wine? If God calls our corn and wine his, he therefore expects to be
served with them; much more with our love and joy, for surely he allows us not
to alienate the best of his gifts from him. When you are therefore going to
pray, call up your affections, which haply are asleep on some creature's lap,
as Jonah in the sides of the ship: 'What mean you, O sleeper? <span class="GramE">arise</span>, call upon your God.' <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default"><span>(2.)
He deserves your affections because he gives you his. He is jealous of you
because he is zealous for you. Well may he complain of your cold dreaming
prayers whose heart is on a flame of love to <span class="GramE">you.</span> High
and admirable are the <span class="GramE">expressions</span> with which he sets
forth his dear love to his people; whatever he does for them is with a zeal. In
protecting of them, 'as birds flying, so will the Lord defend Jerusalem,' that
is, swiftly, as a bird flies full speed to her nest when she perceives her
young is in danger; in avenging them of their enemies, 'the zeal of the Lord of
hosts shall perform this;' in hearing their prayers he does it 'with delight;'
in forgiving their sins he is ready to forgive,' 'multiplies to pardon;' when
they ask one talent he gives them two. Jacob desires a safe egress and regress.
He does this and more than he desired, for he brings him home with two bands.
Not the least mercy he gives but he draws forth his souls and heart with it;
even in his afflicting providences, where he seems to show least love, there
his heart overflows with it. 'O Ephraim, what shall I do unto you? <span class="GramE">my</span> heart is turned within me.' <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default"><span>(3.) He is a good pay-master for
his people's zeal. 'He is a <span class="SpellE">rewarder</span> of them that
diligently seek him,' Heb. 11:6. Never did fervent prayer find cold welcome
with him. Elijah's prayer fetched fire from heaven because it carried
fire to heaven. The tribe of Levi for their zeal were preferred to the
priesthood. <span class="GramE">And why?</span> Surely they who were so zealous
in doing justice on their brethren would be no less zealous in making atonement
for them by their sacrifices. Most men lose their fervency and strength of
their desires by misplacing them; they are zealous for such things as cannot,
and persons that oft will not, pay them for their pains. O how hot is the
covetous man in his chase after the world's pelf! He 'pants after the dust of
the earth,' and that 'on the head of the poor.' But what reward has he for his
labour? After all his getting, like the dogs in pursuit of the hare, he misses
his game, and at last goes often poor and <span class="SpellE">supperless</span>
to bed in his grave; to be sure he dies 'a fool,' Jeremiah 17:11. How many
court-spaniels-that have fawned and flattered, yea, licked up their master's <span class="GramE">spittle,</span> and all for some scraps of preferment -have
befooled themselves, when at last they have seen their creeping sordid
practices rewarded with the fatal stroke of the headsman, or a lingering
consumptive death in their prince's favour? Which made that ambitious cardinal
say too late, <span class="GramE">If</span> he had been as observant of his
heavenly Master as he had been of his earthly, he could not have been left so
miserable at last. In a word, do we not see the superstitious person knocking
his breast and cutting his own flesh, out of <span class="GramE">a zeal</span> to
his wooden god, that has neither ear to hear nor hand to help him? Now, does
not the living God, your loving Father, deserve your zeal more than their dead
and dumb idols do theirs? For shame! Let not <span class="GramE">us</span> be
cold in his worship when the idolater sweats before his god of clouts; let not
the <span class="SpellE">worldling's</span> zeal in pursuit of his earthly mammon
leave you lagging behind with a heedless heartless serving of your God. <span class="GramE">Neither fear the world's hooting at you for your zeal; they think you
a fool, but you know them to be so.</span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default"><span class="GramE"><b><span>[How to raise our affections to fervency in prayer.]</span></b></span><b></b></p>
<p class="Default"><span class="GramE"><b><span>Question.</span></b></span><span>
But how may we get this fervency of spirit in prayer? <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default"><span class="GramE"><b><span>Answer </span></b><span>(a).</span></span><span> You who propound the question are a saint or not; if
not, there is another question must precede this. How you, <span class="GramE">that
are</span> at present in a state of spiritual death, may have spiritual life?
There must be life in the soul before there can be life in the duty. All the
rugs in the upholsterer's shop will not fetch a dead man to warmth, nor <span class="GramE">any arguments, though taken from the most moving topics in the
Scripture, will</span> make you pray fervently while your soul lies in a dead
state. Go first to Christ that you may have life, and having life, <span class="GramE">then</span> there is hope to chafe you into some heat. But, <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default"><b><span>Answer </span></b><span>(b). If you be a saint,
it yet calls for your utmost care to get, and when you have got, to keep, your
soul in a kindly heat. As the stone cannot of itself mount up into the air, so
the bird-though it can do this, yet-cannot stay there long without some labour
and motion with its wings. The saints have a spark of heavenly fire in their
bosom, but this needs the bellows of their care and diligence to keep it alive.
There is a rust that breeds from the gold, a worm from the wood, a moth from
the garment, that in time waste them; and ashes from the coal that choke the
fire; yea, and in the saint too, which will damp his zeal if not cleared by
daily watchfulness. Observe therefore <span class="GramE">what is your chief
impediment to fervency in prayer,</span> and set yourself vigorously against
it. If you be remiss in this <span class="SpellE">precedaneous</span> duty you
will be much more remiss in prayer itself. <span class="GramE">He that knows of a
slough in the way, and mends it not before he takes his journey, has no cause
to wonder when his chariot is laid fast in it.</span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default"><b><span>Answer</span></b><span> (c). Now this is not the
same in all, and therefore it is necessary that you be so much acquainted with your
own estate as to know what is your great clog in this duty. Certainly, were not
the firmament of the saint's soul cooled with some malignant vapours that arise
from his own breast, and weaken the force of divine grace in him, it would be
summer all the year long with him, his heart would be ever warm, and his
affections lively in duty. Look therefore narrowly whence your cooling comes.
Perhaps your heart is too much let out upon the world in the day, and at night
your spirits are spent, when you should come before the Lord in prayer. If you
will be hotter in duty you must be colder towards the world. A horse that
carries a pack all day is unfit to go post at night. Wood that has the sap in
it will not burn easily; neither will your heart readily take fire in holy
duties <span class="GramE">who</span> comes so sopped in the world to them.
Drain, therefore, your heart of these eager affections to that, if you mean to have them warm and lively in this. Now, no better way for this than to set
your soul under the frequent meditation of Christ's love to you, your relation
to him, with the great and glorious things you expect from him in another
world. This, or nothing, will dry up your love to this world, as your wood which
is laid a sunning is made fit for the fire. Whereas, let your hearts continue
soaking in the thoughts of an inordinate love to the world, and you will find,
when you come to pray, that your heart will be in a duty even as a foggy wet log
at the back of a fire, long in kindling, and soon out again. Haply the deadness
of your heart in prayer arises from want of a deep sense of your wants and
mercies you desire to have supplied. Could you but pray feelingly no doubt
but you would pray fervently. The hungry man needs no help from art to <span class="GramE">learn</span> him how to beg; his pinched bowels make him earnest
and eloquent. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default"><span>Is it pardon of sin you would
pray for? First see what anguish of spirit they put you to. Do with your soul as
the <span class="SpellE">chirurgeon</span> with his patient's wounds, who syringes
them with some sharp searching water to try what sense he has of them. Apply
such considerations to your soul as may make you feel their smart, and be
sensible of your deplored estate by reason of them; then go and sleep at prayer
if you can. We have David first affecting his heart, and expressing the <span class="SpellE">dolor</span> of his soul for his sin: '<span class="GramE">My</span>
iniquities are gone over my head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for
me,' Psalm 38:4. Now when his heart is sick with these thoughts, as one with
strong physic working in his stomach, he pours out his soul in prayer to God,
'All my desire is before you; and my groaning is not hid from you,' verse 9. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default"><span>Are you to pray for others?
First pierce your heart through with their sorrows, and, by a spirit of
sympathy, bring yourself to feel their miseries as if you were in their case.
Then will your heart be warm in prayer for them when it flows from a heart
melted in compassion to them. Thus we read Christ troubled himself for Lazarus
before he lifted up his eyes to heaven for him, John 11:33, 38, compared. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default"><span>Again, it may be your want of
zeal proceeds from a defect in your faith. Faith is the back of steel to the
bow of prayer; this sends the arrow with a force to heaven. Where faith is weak
the cry will not be strong. He that goes about a business with little hope to
speed will do it but faintly; he works, as we say, for a dead horse. It is a
true axiom, the less we hope the less we endeavour. We read of strong cries
that Christ put up in the days of his flesh. Now mark what enforced his
prayer-'unto him that was able to save him;' and not only so, but if you look
into that prayer to which this refers, you shall find that he clasped about God
as his God-'My God, my God.' His hold on God held up his spirit in prayer. So
in the several precedents of praying saints upon Scripture record, you may see
how the spirit of prayer ebbed and flowed, fell and rose, as their faith was up
and down. This made David press so hard upon God in the day of his distress: 'I
believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted,' Psalm 116:10. This
made the woman of Canaan so invincibly importunate. Let Christ frown and chide,
deny and rebuke her, she yet makes her approaches nearer and nearer, gathering
arguments from his very denials, as if a soldier should shoot his enemy's
bullets back upon him again; and Christ tells us what kept her spirit
undaunted, 'O woman, great is your faith!' <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="Default"><span>Again, may be it proceeds from
some distaste you have given to the Holy Spirit, who alone can blow up your
affections; and then, no wonder you are cold in prayer when he is gone that
should keep your heart warm at it. What is the body without the soul but cold
clay, dead earth? <span class="GramE">and</span> what the soul without the
Spirit? <span class="GramE">truly</span> no better. O <span class="GramE">invite</span>
him back to your soul, or else your praying work is at an end. And, if you would
persuade him to return, observe <span class="GramE">what was the thing that
distasted him, and remove it</span>. That which makes this dove forsake its <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">lockyers</span></span> will hinder his return if
not taken away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
