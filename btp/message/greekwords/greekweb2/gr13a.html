<p class="MsoNormal"><b class="section-header section-header section-header section-header section-header section-header section-header section-header section-header section-header"><span>Introduction:</span></b><span><b>Meaning of eusebeia (godiness).</b></span></p>
<br/>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Eusebeia
is derived from eu meaning well and sebomai meaning devout.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>It means
to be pious, or to be godly in character.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Godliness is the outworking of the life of Christ dwelling in us.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>See daily verse <a href="../../../../dailyverses/sept13/dvsept25.html" target="_blank"><span class="text-primary">Life and godliness (<span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref"><span class="scripture-ref">2 Peter 1:3</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>)</span></a></span></p>
<br/>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>'Eusebeia' is a word associated with worship.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Acts
17:23For as I passed by, and beheld
your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD.
Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship (eusebeo), him declare I unto you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>True
worship is the expression of love towards God from the heart.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>It is expressed
in joyful obedience to the will of God as well as in proclamation and song. It is never legalistic. It is always motivated by love.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Eusebeia
in this context is a word that describes a life that glorifies the Lord.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>Examples:Life of worship.</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The
whole of the Christian life is to be an act of worship.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Godliness
is piety but it is led from the heart.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>It is
rooted in love not legalism which is selfish and external.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>Personal Story:</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>I was at
a church meeting when a word came into my mind that the Lord does not rule His
people with a rod of iron, but the Lord rules His people with a scepter of
gold. As I
thought on this, I began to see that the rod of iron is used against enemies or
to force unwilling people to obey. It
symbolizes the wrath of the King.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The
scepter of gold does not reveal the wrath of the King but the beauty and splendour of His
character.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The
Lords people are not motivated by fear of His wrath but by love.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>As I
thought about this someone sitting behind me put some money into my hand.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>At the
end of the meeting I asked why the person had done it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The person replied that he had felt the Lord leading him to do it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>It was a
wonderful demonstration of the moving of the Holy Spirit.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>First He gave me a word of how
the Lords people are moved by love not wrath and then just at that exact moment
it was like the Lord stretched out the golden scepter to the person sitting
behind me, and he responded in an act of worship and gave me a much needed
gift.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>Main Points</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>1. Life
and godliness (eusebeia).</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>2 Peter
1:3According as his divine power hath
given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the
knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Given
us all things that pertain to life (zoe) and godliness (eusebeia).</span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph"><b><span><span>a)</span></span></b><b><span>The life of Christ in us (zoe).</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Christianity
is not religion. It is new life in
Christ. It is new birth. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The old
is gone new life has come.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>Difference between Religion and Christianity</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Religion
is by nature based upon works. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>A priestly hierarchy must maintain the belief that grace is administered through the various forms of sacraments.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>It
offers the hope of forgiveness but with conditions that will maintain the authority of a priestly hierarchy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>This kind of religion can produce charitable works but can never bring the peace of justification through faith in Christ alone.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Biblical
Christianity is the message of new life.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>In
Christ my life is crucified with Christ and I am raised a completely new
creation.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>I am
born into the family of God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>My life
is hid with Christ.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The old
is completely wiped away.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Sin does
not have dominion over me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"><b><span><span>b)</span></span></b><b><span>The outworking of His life in us - godliness (eusebeia).</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Eusebeia
is the outworking of new life.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>It is
not the result of zeal for salvation. It
is the fruit of salvation.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Good
works are the evidence of new life.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>They
should be evident in the lives of Christian women.1 Timothy 2:10But (which becomes women professing
godliness eusebeia) with good works.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Eusebeia
is profitable to all things.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Promise
of life in the present and life in the future.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>1 Timothy
4:8For bodily exercise profits little:
but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that
now is, and of that which is to come.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>This
does not mean that if we are godly then we are promised life now and in the
future.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>We can
only be godly when we have new life.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Godliness
reveals the promise of new life in us right now and confirms the promise of
resurrected life in the future.</span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph"><b><span><span>c)</span></span></b><b><span>Follow after godliness</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>1
Timothy 6:11But thou, O man of God,
flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love,
patience, meekness.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Follow righteousness guarding our heart and mind from wrong desires.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Follow godliness producing good works so Christ is seen in us.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Cultivating the fruit of the Spirit - led by the Spirit and putting off the works of the flesh.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>2. The
mystery of godliness (eusebeia).</span></b><span>1 Timothy 3:16And without controversy great is the mystery
of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of
angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into
glory.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Eusebeia
is the outworking of a heart of worship.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>It is
characterized by humility and love.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>It
stands in contrast to pride and ambition.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The primary
concern of eusebeia is not self interest but to glorify the Father, and
concern for the well being of others.</span></p>
