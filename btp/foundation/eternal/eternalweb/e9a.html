Melchisedek was both King and a Priest.<span> This was impossible under the Aaronic priesthood. The priests were Levites.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Jesus was not a priest after the order of Aaron. Jesus was of the kingly line of Judah.<span> He could not enter Holy Place in the temple.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">When Jesus was crucified Pilate wrote "</span>Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews<span class="italic text-gray-600">".<span> Jesus hung on the cross as both King and Priest. He offered His life as a sacrifice for sin.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>b)</strong> King of Righteousness.<span> His name is Righteousness. It depicts one who is inherently righteous.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Jesus Christ is the Righteous One. His name is Jehovah Tsidkenu, The Lord our righteousness. Jeremiah 23:5-6<span> <span class="italic text-gray-600">"Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth. In his days</span>Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this <i>is</i> his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS."</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Evidence of being born again of the Spirit of God is righteousness.1 John 2:29<span> <span class="italic text-gray-600">"If you know that he is righteous, you know that every one that does righteousness is born of him."</span> 1 John 3:7 <span class="italic text-gray-600">"Little children, let no man deceive you: he that does righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous."</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>c)</strong> King of Salem - The city of Melchisedek is peace.<span> This is where He rules.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Jesus is King of peace.2 Thessalonians 3:16<span> Now</span> the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means.
