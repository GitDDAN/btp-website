The temple was still the heart of the nation and the centre of the Jewish religion.<span> The everyday affairs of the temple carried on exactly the same, and the people gloried in the outward appearance of the magnificent building that Herod had built.

Many people in the Church have no desire for the presence of the Lord. They are satisfied with living as Christians and being respectable people in the community. They do not want to become fools for Christ, or to be worshipping witnesses to Christ. They are genuinely saved, but they have no desire for worship beyond singing some songs of worship. They are missing the highest calling of God to become worshippers.</span></li> </ul> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Exposition:</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>1.</strong> The temple is the place where the glory of God dwells.</p> <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-4" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal">Isaiah saw a place where God sits enthroned in the heavens; where the angels of God worship crying "</span>Holy, Holy, Holy<span class="italic text-gray-600">".<span> The temple where His glory dwells.
