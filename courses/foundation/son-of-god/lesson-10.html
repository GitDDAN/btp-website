The oil is free to us but the cost was not cheap. It cost the life of the Son of God.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The oil of the Holy Spirit is new life in Christ.<span> This is received through repentance and faith.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">We must know for certain that we are born again of the Spirit of God (John 3:3).</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Only those who have the oil of new life in Christ will be ready when Jesus returns.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span><strong>3.</strong> Giving all.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The words of C.T Studd, "If Jesus Christ be God and died for me then what sacrifice can be too great for me a mere mortal man to make for Him.<span class="italic text-gray-600">"</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>a)</strong> Giving all means being willing to lay our lives down for the Lord.Revelation 12:11 <span class="italic text-gray-600">"And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death."</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The Son of God gave His life so that we could be redeemed.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">If He gave everything for us then how much more should we lay our lives down for Him.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>b)</strong> Giving all for Him means being willing to lay our lives down for one another.1 John 3:16<span> "</span>Hereby perceive we the love <i>of God</i>, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down <i>our</i> lives for the brethren.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Love for one another in serving one another.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">When God<span class="italic text-gray-600">'s people are filled with the love of God there will be the freedom to serve one another.<span> There will be closer fellowship.</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">A church can preach the gospel and be filled with lovely people but there is a big difference when the people are led by the love of God. <span>1 John 3:17-18<span> "</span>But whoso hath this worlds good, and sees his brother have need, and shuts up his bowels <i>of compassion</i> from him, how dwells the love of God in him?
