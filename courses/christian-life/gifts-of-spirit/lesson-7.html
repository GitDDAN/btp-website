<p><strong>The
Ministry of the Holy Spirit in the New </strong><strong>Testament</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Church</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Course: The Gifts of the Spirit</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lesson
7</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lesson
Title:</strong>
Prophecy</p>
<p><strong>Text:</strong> 'to another prophecy; ' 1 Corinthians 12:9. </p>
<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> <strong>What is the gift of
Prophecy?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Prophecy</strong> Greek propheteia
(pro forth and phemi to speak) literally means
to speak forth.</p>
<p>A
prophecy is the speaking forth of a message that is given for the purpose of </p>
<p>1) building up a believer in his or her
spiritual life or </p>
<p>2) to come to his or her aid for a specific
purpose. </p>
<p><strong>The
gift of prophecy is not the same as the ministry of a prophet.</strong></p>
<p>The Gift
of Prophecy is given for edification, exhortation and comfort.</p>
<p>It is
not predictive. </p>
<p>If
something is revealed concerning a future event this is a Word of Wisdom not
prophecy.</p>
<p>
a) An Old Testament prophet was a
seer. </p>
<p>The
ministry of the prophet was to guide the people in righteousness, and to warn
of the consequences of disobedience.</p>
<p>The
prophet proclaimed what God was saying to the people at a specific time. </p>
<p>It was
necessary for the prophet to say what was going to happen.</p>
<p>Therefore
a prophet spoke concerning the present or the past, and foretold future events
in regard to judgment and restoration.</p>
<p>
b) The ministry of a prophet in
the New Testament is to guide the people in righteousness, and to warn of the consequences of
disobedience. This involves foretelling
future events (a Word of Wisdom) as well as speaking concerning the present and
past.</p>
<p>This is
very different from the gift of prophecy.</p>
<p><strong>The
Gift of Prophecy is given for edification, exhortation, and comfort</strong></p>
<p>1
Corinthians 14:3 But
he that prophesieth speaketh
unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>1) Edification - </strong>Greek Oikodome (oikos a home and demo to build) literally means to
build a home.<strong></strong></p>
<p>Edification
refers to being built up in our spiritual life</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>2) Exhortation </strong> Greek paraklesis
(para to the side and kaleo
to call) literally means calling to ones side. </p>
<p>Exhortation
refers to a message that comes to ones aid.
It is a support that helps us for a particular purpose.</p>
<p><strong>3) Comfort - </strong>Greek paramuthia
(para to the side and muthos
speech) literally means speaking closely - by the side.<strong></strong></p>
<p>Comfort
refers to a message that expresses tenderness and concern in a particular
situation. It is more personal than an
exhortation. </p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Personal
Testimony: Example of the Gift of
Prophecy</strong></p>
<p>When I receive a word of prophecy it
usually begins with a scripture.</p>
<p>For instance one evening I was at a meeting
and the word came to me that the Lord has not called his people to be a voice
crying in the wilderness. I did not
understand the meaning at first, but then it became clear as the message came
that a wilderness is a barren place and the Lord has called His people to
fruitfulness. The prophecy continued
that these are not the days of Moses for he longed for the day when the Lord
would pour out His Spirit upon all the people, and these are not the days of
Elijah when the people had to go to the anointed prophet, but these are the
days of the prophet Joel when the Lord has poured out His Spirit upon all His
people.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Main
Points </strong></p>
<p><strong>1.
The Gift of Prophecy in Scripture</strong></p>
<p><strong>a)
In the Old Testament</strong></p>
<p>The Gift
of Prophecy is seen in the Old Testament</p>
<p><strong>Moses</strong></p>
<p>When the
anointing came upon the elders they moved in the gift of prophecy.</p>
<p>In the
New Testament when the Spirit came upon believers they spoke in tongues and
prophesied.</p>
<p>Tongues
are not manifested in the Old Testament because tongues are the moving of the
Holy Spirit expressing the desire of the heart.
</p>
<p>A new
tongue needs a new heart. The </p>
<p>The 70
elders moved in the gift of prophesy, Numbers 11:25-26</p>
<p>The
moving of the Holy Spirit upon the elders brought concern for Moses leadership.</p>
<p>Moses
had no concern for his own leadership he was called to lead the people not
control the people. The Holy Spirit was
in control.</p>
<p>Moses
desired that all of Gods people were prophets, Numbers 11:29.</p>
<p>This
desire of Moses looks right across the Old Testament into the New Testament.</p>
<p><strong>Saul</strong></p>
<p>Saul did
not have a right heart towards the Lord he was not a David.</p>
<p>But even
though his heart was not right, he still moved in the gifts of the Spirit. </p>
<p>Saul
exercised the gift of prophecy when he came under the anointing, 1 Samuel
10:11-12.</p>
<p><strong>Joel</strong> </p>
<p>The
prophet Joel spoke of the time when the Lord was going to pour out His Spirit
upon all flesh</p>
<p>Joel
2:28-29 And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon
all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall
dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:
And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I
pour out my spirit.</p>
<p>Joel
spoke of sons and daughters prophesying. </p>
<p>The Gift
of Prophecy is not a special ministry to be expressed by a few people. </p>
<p>The Gift
of Prophecy should be common among believers.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>b) In the New Testament.</strong></p>
<p>The fulfilment of the prophecy of the prophet Joel on the Day of
Pentecost. Acts 2:16-18 But this is that which was spoken by the
prophet Joel; And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith
God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your
daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old
men shall dream dreams: And on my
servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and
they shall prophesy:</p>
<p>The
servants and handmaidens are also expected to prophesy.</p>
<p>The Ephesian believers spoke in tongues and prophesied when the
Holy Spirit came upon them.</p>
<p>Acts 19:6 And when Paul
had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.</p>
<p><strong>2.
Testimonies concerning the operation of the gift.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Personal
Testimony: </strong></p>
<p>One Sunday morning I received a word of
prophecy. The words came to me that the
Lord does not rule His people with a rod of iron, but the Lord rules His people
with a sceptre of gold. </p>
<p>As the prophecy developed I saw that a rod
of iron reveals His strength, and the Lord will rule over His enemies with a
rod of iron, but the sceptre of gold reveals His nature and His character, the
beauty of who He is. The Lords people
respond to the sceptre of gold out of love for the Lord Jesus. </p>
<p>I felt the word was personal and did not
share it at that time.</p>
<p>Just as I received the word of prophecy a
person sitting behind me put his hand into mine and gave me a gift. I asked him afterwards why he had done
it. He said he just felt to do it. </p>
<p>The Lord gave me a word of prophecy that He
rules His people by love, and then the word was demonstrated by one moved upon
by the Holy Spirit at that exact moment.</p>
<p>This is
New Testament ministry.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>3.
Why is this gift necessary today?</strong></p>
<p> <strong>a) Scripture tells us to desire to prophesy.</strong></p>
<p>We are
to desire spiritual gifts especially to Prophecy (1 Corinthians 14:1)</p>
<p>If we
desire to prophecy then we must be filled with the scriptures. The Holy Spirit will always speak in accordance
with the scriptures. If we do not know
the scriptures then the Holy Spirit cannot bring the scripture into our minds.</p>
<p>The Gift
of Prophecy can operate at any time. </p>
<p>We should
always expect the Holy Spirit to speak through us right into a specific
situation.</p>
<p>Sometimes
the Holy Spirit can tell someone to pickup the phone to give a word of
encouragement.</p>
<p><strong> b)
Prophecy builds up the Church. </strong></p>
<p>Prophecy
is necessary for edification, exhortation and comfort (14:3)</p>
<p>Prophecy
builds up the Church
(14:4).</p>
<p>Prophecy will bring conviction, 1
Corinthians 14:24-25 But if all
prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or <em>one</em> unlearned, he
is convinced of all, he is judged of all:
And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down
on <em>his</em> face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a
truth.</p>
<p>Tongues and interpretation should be limited in a
meeting but not prophecy.</p>
<p>The gift of prophecy can function during a persons
preaching.</p>
<p><strong> c)
The Gift of Prophecy is a gift that every believer should seek to move
in. </strong></p>
<p>It is a wonderful gift given to bless the
Church.</p>
<p>Some people say there is no need for this
gift now that we have the scriptures.</p>
<p><strong>The
Gift of Prophecy does not replace the scriptures it puts the spotlight on to a
particular aspect of scripture.</strong></p>
<p>It is a word brought by the Holy Spirit that is
needed for a particular purpose at a specific time.</p>
