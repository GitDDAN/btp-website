<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">This was a time of
spiritual declension. Yet in the mending lofts, on the boats and along the
quays there were those who had a hunger for God. Days and nights were spent in
prayer before the Throne of Grace. God had moved upon the hearts of these
people who had little education and whose material means were limited, but who
were "<span class="SpellE">far­ben</span>" with Him. They knew the way
into God's presence and took time to wait upon the Lord. In a few years time it
was proved that, 'They that wait upon the Lord shall mount up with wings as
eagles'. (Isaiah 40 v 31) These men 'whose hearts the Lord had touched', had
received a vision and were wining to wait upon God until the vision became a
reality.Tremendous things had already
taken place a few years previous when times of refreshing from the presence of
the Lord were experienced in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Wales</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span lang="EN-GB">
during the revival in 1904. Coal miners were converted in their thousands and
whole villages were moved for God. Much more was accomplished in one night than
men had tried to do in many years. On that occasion a humble man called Evan
Roberts was used by God.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Men were being
prepared for the coming days. One of these was the Rev. A. Douglas Brown, a
Baptist minister from </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">London</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB">. Son of one of C.H. <span class="GramE">Spurgeon '</span> s workers
during the time when Spurgeon was minister at the Metropolitan Tabernacle in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">London</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB">. </span><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Douglas</span></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB"> had this to say,
"My father's life was a constant and sacred inspiration to me, not only
during my early life, but in the later years until he fell asleep in Jesus.
Whatever blessing has come to other lives through my ministry and evangelistic
work, I owe, under God, to the inspiration, advice and example of one <span class="GramE">who</span> by his fidelity to the truth and loyalty to Christ,
awakened in my heart the </span><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Calvary</span></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB"> passion for souls." There is no doubt that </span><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Douglas</span></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB"> had been reared in the
principles of revival through the personal life and teaching of his father.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">As he ministered
to his congregation week after week, <span class="GramE">this shy</span> man,
although he had an exper­ience of salvation, remained aloof from his
people.One day he received a new touch
from God. He left his pulpit, came down and walked among his congregation.
Everyone received a handshake and when he confessed his lack of concern, tears
of repentance and rejoicing followed. What a day it was when amidst all the
ritual, God broke a man at His feet. </span><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Douglas</span></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">'s ministry was re­volutionised, blessing crowned it from that
day.He experienced what Jesus said in
John chapter 12 <span class="GramE">verse</span> 24, "Except a corn of wheat
fall into the ground and die, it <span class="SpellE">abideth</span> alone, but
if it die, it <span class="SpellE">bringeth</span> forth much fruit." The
transform­ation that took place that day was to be the means of </span><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Douglas</span></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">. Brown going into
places and situations he would never have thought possible, not even in his
wildest dreams. He was to become one of the great evangelists of the
1920s.The godly Rev. J. Stuart Holden
of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">St. Paul</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB">'s, </span><st1:address><st1:street><span lang="EN-GB">Port­man Square</span></st1:street><span lang="EN-GB">, </span><st1:city><span lang="EN-GB">London</span></st1:city></st1:address><span lang="EN-GB"> had this to say of him, "He is a teacher sent from God. His
words have a power of penetration whether they be spoken or in the printed
page. His subject is always Christ, and hence the Divine authentication of his <span class="GramE">words,</span> and that has made him amongst the most successful
evangelists of our day."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It was in February
1921 that Douglas Brown came into that great experience and fully surrend­ered
his life to God. On the last Sunday of Feb­ruary 1921, ninety six people came
forward for Christ in the evening service at his church. Within four days he
found himself in </span><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Lowestoft</span></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB"> where God saved many souls at meetings conducted in </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span lang="EN-GB">London</span></st1:placename><st1:placename><span lang="EN-GB">Road</span></st1:placename><st1:placename><span lang="EN-GB">Baptist</span></st1:placename><st1:placetype><span lang="EN-GB">Church</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">.In the Annual Report of the Faith Mission mag­azine
"Bright Words" of July 1921, the record states, "Spiritual
blessing has arisen in the East of England<span class="GramE">. '</span>All East
Anglia is on fire for God' is a statement made by the Rev. A. Douglas Brown who
is being principally used in this remarkable movement which started at
Lowestoft, and has since extended to Ipswich, Yarmouth and other places."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Douglas Brown was
to be one of the key ins­truments in the hand of God when He moved later that
year among the fisher-folks. How wonderful to realise that God's methods are
men.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Away at the other
end of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Britain</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span lang="EN-GB"> in a fishing town called Wick, in </span><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Caithness</span></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">, God was preparing
another servant who was going to be used. God takes the most unlikely people to
do His work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">He took David to
defeat the enemies of Israel in the valley of Elah. Elijah the Tishbite was called to stand on Mount Carmel against the prophets
of Baal. A humble fisherman called Peter was to be His instrument on the day of Pentecost. When God chose Jock Troup for
His work, He was following the pattern He had established in Scripture.
"God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the things
which are mighty." (1 Corinthians chapter 1 verse 7).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Jock Troup, whose
name was to become famous in many places in the days to come, was born in
Morayshire in 1896. He came with his parents to </span><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Caithness</span></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB"> as a boy. Wick was
then the pre­mier herring port in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Scotland</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span lang="EN-GB">.
<span class="GramE">The.</span> <span class="GramE">economy</span> of the town depended
on the harvest of the "Silver Darlings", as the herring were called.
Jocks parents were well known in Wick, his father for his skill in playing the
mandolin, while Mrs. Troup owned a pie and tea shop in the main street.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">When Jock left
school he went to train as a "cooper" with the firm of Fleet in their
curing yard on the <span class="SpellE">Pulteney</span> side of Wick. This type
of work was very hard and required long hours.Whenever the young apprentice was free he began to pursue pleasure. At
work he became a very skilled cooper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">War clouds were
gathering over </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Britain</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span lang="EN-GB"> and soon the 1914-18 conflict would commence. Jock was called up
and joined the Royal Naval Patrol Service. He became a crew member of the steam
drifter <span class="SpellE">Strombo</span> which was based outside </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Dublin</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> at a place called
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Kingston</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB">. The crew was made up of godless men who spent much time gambling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">When ashore, Jock
attended Gospel meetings on a Sunday night in Dublin Y.M.C.A. where a Mr. &amp;
Mrs. West were in charge who were keen soul winners for Jesus. One Sunday night
after Mr. West preached Jock said, "I think I'll get converted." <span class="GramE">Although this was spoken in a light manner, the prayers 'of some
friends in Wick were being answered.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The old fashioned conviction
of sin was heavy upon Jock. He stopped swearing, smoking and tried to turn over
a new leaf. During the long days on patrol he was restless, his darkened soul
could find no peace, so he made up his mind to go and see Mrs. West when he got
ashore. By this time the conviction of sin was so heavy that he was afraid to
sleep lest he wake up in hell. True to his resolve, when his patrol was
finished, he went to see Mrs. West, .who dealt with him from the Word of God.
This seeking soul could not grasp the truth of free salvation. While he made
his way back to the ship the Devil told him that he was one of the damned.
Instead of going to the cabin, Jock went into the wheelhouse and prayed to God
for salvation. Immediately the transaction took place and he found "A
Saviour, Christ the Lord". God had got His man who was to be "a sharp
<span class="GramE">instrument having</span> teeth" in the days to come.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Jock took his
stand for Christ right away. After the incident in the wheelhouse he went to
the cabin where the crew were playing cards and boldly testified to salvation.
Some of the crew mocked, but the One Who had saved him, stood by him. That
night he went across to another ship called the "Sparkling Star"
which was on the same patrol. A stalwart for Christ named Andy <span class="SpellE">Duthie</span> was her skipper and he was asleep. The new convert
woke him and told what had happened. This wise Christian replied, "Son,
you've made the greatest and finest decision any­one can make. You have a
friend in me always." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Wherever he went
the transformed man testified and sweetly sang the "Songs of Zion".<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In 1919 Jock
returned to his trade in Wick. As he made barrels for the herring industry, the
locals realised that a great change had come into his life. He lived in the
reality of 2 Corinthians<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="GramE"><span lang="EN-GB">chapter</span></span><span lang="EN-GB"> 5, verse 11, "If any man be in Christ, be is a new creature:
old things are passed away: behold, all things are become new".Jock attached himself to the Salvation Army
and bore a bright testimony for God in Wick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">While in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Aberdeen</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> prior to
going to </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Yarmouth</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> in 1921, he attended meetings in the Fishermen's mission at </span><st1:street><st1:address><span lang="EN-GB">200 Market Street</span></st1:address></st1:street><span lang="EN-GB">. There he was challenged by preaching on "A clean heart"
and a 'Filled Life". As he longed to be his best for God, he prayed for
the experience that would make him an effective witness for Christ. God
answered his cry and something glorious happened there and then. Jock received
such a filling of the Holy Spirit that he had to leave the meeting.Going up a "close" beside the hall,
he stood alone with God and rejoiced over what was done in his life. He seldom
talked about this experience because it was so sacred to him, but when he did,
he spoke with great reverence. The yielded life was now on God's altar and
little did he know then that God would take the willing sac­rifice and use the
broken but filled life for His glory. His dedicated heart could now sing,<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"Thy Holy

<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="GramE"><span lang="EN-GB">Has

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">From <span class="SpellE">Thurso</span> on the </span><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">North
 Caithness</span></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB"> coast right south to <span class="SpellE">Eyemouth</span> in Berwickshire things had developed into a
pattern. Gospel missions were conducted with a few getting saved, but nothing
spectacular was taking place. Yet, at <span class="SpellE">Cairnbulg</span>, a
fishing village not very far from <span class="SpellE">Fraserburgh</span> there
was a "sound of a going in the mulberrytrees".<span class="SpellE">Cairnbulg</span> was the
home of some well known godly men who lived in the "secret place of the
Most High".Just after the 1914-18
war one such man was Jimmy "<span class="SpellE">Denley</span>"
Ritchie.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A Welshman called Pastor
Fred Clarke came to conduct a series of evangelistic meetings in the winter
months of 1919. These services were held in the <span class="SpellE">Cairnbulg</span>
Gospel Hall, known locally as the "<span class="SpellE">Bulgar</span>
Hall", for a fortnight. God blessed His word and about a dozen souls
professed sal­vation. Converted at that time was a young fisher lassie whom God
was to use during the "times of refreshing" in 1921. Later she would
join the Faith Mission and sit under the ministry of John George Govan, its
founder. She was an old woman when I met her and she told me of how the young
converts, when encouraged to pray by Pastor Clarke, prayed for days and nights.
This contin­ued for months, even when Pastor Clarke had left. These requests
were not to go unheard, for God was going to answer the cries of His people,
who sought Him continually.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Pastor Clarke,
along with Mr. George Bell, who was a Scotsman, returned in the autumn of 1921
to the same "<span class="SpellE">Bulgar</span> Hall". 'On this visit
to <span class="SpellE">Cairnbulg</span>, these servants of Christ laboured with
no visible results. The evangelists decided it was time to move on to fresh
pastures. On the Sunday night in October 1921 when the meet­ings were supposed
to finish, Jimmy "<span class="SpellE">Denley</span>" Ritchie came to
Pastor Clarke and said, "Pastor, God has told me that blessing is going to
break out here. You cannot leave." The villages around <span class="SpellE">Fraserburgh</span>
were to feel the impact of God's Spirit from that night on. Mr. Clarke and Mr.
Bell stayed among these villages for four months. Conversions were most evident
amongst the 16 to 18 years age group. Young folk who attended the dance hall
which was next to the Gospel hall came to disturb the meeting. One night Pastor
Clarke stated. "The Devil's agents are in our midst tonight, but we are
claiming them for Jesus." So many young' folk were saved the dance <span class="SpellE">hatl</span> had to close. Many men and women had left <span class="SpellE">Cairnbulg</span> for the East <span class="SpellE">Anglian</span>
fishing season when God started to move.Telegrams were sent to </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Yarmouth</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> telling friends that some of their relations had got saved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Peterhead also had
its characters who were firebrands for Christ. One of these was "Petrie <span class="SpellE">Shonie</span>" <span class="SpellE">Strachan</span>. Saved
during the year of the Welsh Revival in 1904, Petrie became a great wit­ness
and soul winner. Constantly called at any hour of the day or night to lead the
sick and dying to Christ, this godly soul was a man who never believed in idle
talk. During the 1914-18 war when in the Navy at </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Portsmouth</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB">, he
attended a service in which the Padre failed to turn up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Petrie got up and
sang the hymn, "Take the Name of Jesus with you, child of sorrow and of
woe". Then he preached and at the end of the servicefifteen men professed salvation. He
became a soldier in the Salvation Army. On one occasion the officer in charge
took ill and Petrie took the service and preached on baptism by immersion even
although he was not baptized him­self.Later he went to the Salvation Army officer and explained how he became
convicted about baptism.Soon after this
he was baptized in obedience to the command of Christ. In the Army meetings on
Sunday afternoons his testimony would be a real inspiration. Some of those
present recounted how he would stand in the passage with his hands raised to
heaven and sing, "Come <span class="SpellE">hame</span>, come <span class="SpellE">hame</span>, you're welcome <span class="SpellE">noo</span>, your

baptized at the mouth of the River <span class="SpellE">Ugie</span> near
Peterhead in the month of Dec­ember when the snow was thick on the ground.
Petrie was a soldier for Christ right to the end. Many bore testimony to the
influence of Christ in their lives through that humble servant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Another warrior
was "Black Bill's Robbie". Converted in the "bush rope"
hole of a fishing boat, he had a marvellous testimony for Christ.This rugged character once jumped off
Peterhead breakwater in a raging storm in an attempt to rescue a man who had
been washed into the water. He was fearless in his attempts to win the lost
souls of men and women for Christ.Before he was converted he could neither read nor write and Petrie <span class="SpellE">Shonie's</span> wife taught him to do just that. He got a notebook
and began to write all his experiences in it. As he gave his testimony he would
hold up his notebook and<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="GramE"><span lang="EN-GB">say</span></span><span lang="EN-GB">, "This book contains the story of my life since I got
saved." His favourite song when giving his testimony in the Salvation Army
meetings on Sunday afternoon was,<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"Lay by your
old compass, <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="SpellE"><span lang="EN-GB">T'will</span></span><span lang="EN-GB"> <span class="GramE">do</span>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Mind your helm

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">And don't fall
asleep,<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Watch and pray
night and day lest you sink in the deep".<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Andy <span class="SpellE">Duthie</span> was another stalwart for the Cross. He bore a bright
testimony for Christ. As an old fashioned Methodist he was a great student of
the teachings of John Wesley. His fav­ourite hymn was "And can it be that
I should <span class="GramE">gain,</span> an interest in the Saviour's
blood". The lines which echoed his experience on conversion were,<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span lang="EN-GB">"My chains fell off,<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span lang="EN-GB">My heart was free,<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span lang="EN-GB">I rose, went forth<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="GramE"><i><span lang="EN-GB">And followed Thee".</span></i></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">When he quoted
these words a ring of sincerity flowed from his lips.It was to this brother that Jock Troup came
in order to tell him that he had got saved. Andy proved true to his word and
remained a friend of the cooper-evangelist until he went home to his
reward.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It was thrilling
to hear him tell about the incident aboard the Sparkling Star that night in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Kingston</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB">
harbour.Andy remained at Jock's side
and encouraged him during the move of God at </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Yarmouth</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> 1921, and
constantly stood with him when he visited Peterhead.This precious brother was getting on in years
when I was a young Christian, and to hear him give his testimony on a Sunday
afternoon in the Salvation Army, or in the Fishermen's </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Mission</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> on a
Saturday evening brought blessing to my heart.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">These men and
others would meet for "Knee Drill" at </span><st1:time hour="6" minute="30"><span lang="EN-GB">6.30 a.m.</span></st1:time><span lang="EN-GB"> every
Sunday morning when they would shed tears and cry to God on behalf of souls. It
must have been a wonderful sight to see the seats wet with their tears as these
men and women prayed for God to move.Men like "<span class="SpellE">Aikie</span> Touch" <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Strachan</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span>
a trophy of grace if ever there was one, constantly sought God for the lost
souls of men. Is it any wonder that God moved?These people honoured the Holy Spirit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In the autumn of
1921 a missionary from </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">South
  Africa</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span lang="EN-GB"> was holding
meetings in a hall in </span><st1:street><st1:address><span lang="EN-GB">Prince
  Street</span></st1:address></st1:street><span lang="EN-GB">. Sensing that
amongst some of God's people there was a concern for souls which he had seldom <span class="GramE">seen,</span> this missionary went to </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Glasgow</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> where he
met the evangelist Alex Marshall. As they talked together he told Mr. Marshall,
"I suggest you get to Peterhead, there is a work ripening, I am sure God
is going to bless in a definite way." The evangelist arrived in Peterhead
and commenced a fortnight's meetings on a Sunday night. The following Thursday
a real break came when three souls professed salvation. One of these was an
aunt of mine who went to live in St. <span class="SpellE">Monance</span>, </span><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Fife</span></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">, where she bore a lovely
testimony for Christ during her whole lifetime.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A young fisherman
who later became a prom­inent businessman was one of the three saved that
night. He went into local council work where he took a stand for Christian
principles. The third was a man who suffered a serious injury during the war.
As Mr. Marshall could only stay in Peterhead for a fortnight, Mr. David Walker
of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Aberdeen</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> arrived to continue the meetings. God had begun to move even before
the <span class="SpellE">fisherfolk</span> went on to </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">East Anglia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span lang="EN-GB">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In the extreme
north of Scotland Wick became a haven for many fishermen during the herring ­season.
Like so many other ports, Wick shared in the spiritual dearth that abounded
after the 1914-18 war, yet when the herring fleets gathered, and Christians
joined in fellowship, Wick was well able to put to the forefront some godly
men.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">One of these
soldiers of Christ was Billie Stewart who was saved before the 1914-18
war.He knew the protection of God while
on a naval patrol off Shetland during the war years. His ship the 'Adequate'
was sunk but the entire crew was rescued. As a Salvationist he proudly stood
for the "Blood and Fire", and was a great asset during the revival.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span lang="EN-GB">Baptist</span></st1:placename><st1:placetype><span lang="EN-GB">Church</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB"> was
blest by the godly, gracious life of their minister, Mr. Millard.As a caring pastor of the flock, he possessed
a trem­endous evangelistic thrust and constantly held campaigns using visiting
evangelists. It was amongst these men that God had His diamond which was to cut
deep into the <span class="GramE">Devil' s</span> ranks in the days ahead. That
diamond was none other than Jock Troup.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
