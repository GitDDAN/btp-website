<p><b>Lesson Title: Godliness 'Eusebeia'</b></p>
<span>1 Timothy 6:11'But you, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness <i>(eusebeia)</i>, faith, love, patience, meekness.'</span></p>
<p><b>Introduction:</b><span><b>Meaning of 'eusebeia' (godiness).</b></span></p>
<p>'Eusebeia'
is derived from 'eu' meaning well and 'sebomai' meaning devout.</p>
<p>It means
to be pious, or to be godly in character.</p>
<p>Godliness is the outworking of the life of Christ dwelling in us.</p>
<p><span>See daily verse <a href="/dailyverses/sept13/dvsept25.html" target="_blank"><span class="text-primary">Life and godliness (2 Peter 1:3)</span></a></span></p>
<p>'Eusebeia' is a word associated with worship.</p>
<p>Acts
17:23'For as I passed by, and beheld
your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD.
Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship (eusebeo), him declare I unto you.'</p>
<p>True
worship is the expression of love towards God from the heart.</p>
<p>It is expressed
in joyful obedience to the will of God as well as in proclamation and song. It is never legalistic. It is always motivated by love.</p>
<p>'Eusebeia'
in this context is a word that describes a life that glorifies the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> </p>
<p>The
whole of the Christian life is to be an act of worship.</p>
<p>Godliness
is piety but it is led from the heart.</p>
<p>It is
rooted in love not legalism which is selfish and external.</p>
<p><b>Personal Story:</b></p>
<p>I was at
a church meeting when a word came into my mind that 'the Lord does not rule His
people with a rod of iron, but the Lord rules His people with a scepter of
gold'. As I
thought on this, I began to see that the rod of iron is used against enemies or
to force unwilling people to obey.It
symbolizes the wrath of the King.</p>
<p>The
scepter of gold does not reveal the wrath of the King but the beauty and splendour of His
character.</p>
<p>The
Lord's people are not motivated by fear of His wrath but by love.</p>
<p>As I
thought about this someone sitting behind me put some money into my hand.</p>
<p>At the
end of the meeting I asked why the person had done it.</p>
<p>The person replied that he had felt the Lord leading him to do it.</p>
<p>It was a
wonderful demonstration of the moving of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>First He gave me a word of how
the Lord's people are moved by love not wrath and then just at that exact moment
it was like the Lord stretched out the golden scepter to the person sitting
behind me, and he responded in an act of worship and gave me a much needed
gift.</p>
<h2>Main Points</h2>
<h3>1. Life
and godliness (eusebeia).</h3>

<p>2 Peter
1:3'According as his divine power hath
given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the
knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:'</p>
<p>'Given
us all things that pertain to life (zoe) and godliness (eusebeia).'</p>
<p><b>a)</b><b>The life of Christ in us (zoe).</b></p>
<p>Christianity
is not religion.It is new life in
Christ.It is new birth. </p>
<p>The old
is gone - new life has come.</p>
<p><b>Difference between Religion and Christianity</b></p>
<p>Religion
is by nature based upon works. </p>
<p>A priestly hierarchy must maintain the belief that grace is administered through the various forms of sacraments.</p>
<p>It
offers the hope of forgiveness but with conditions that will maintain the authority of a priestly hierarchy.</p>
<p>This kind of religion can produce charitable works but can never bring the peace of justification through faith in Christ alone.</p>
<p>Biblical
Christianity is the message of new life.</p>
<p>In
Christ my life is crucified with Christ and I am raised a completely new
creation.</p>
<p>I am
born into the family of God.</p>
<p>My life
is hid with Christ.</p>
<p>The old
is completely wiped away.</p>
<p>Sin does
not have dominion over me.</p>
<p><b>b)</b><b>The outworking of His life in us - godliness (eusebeia).</b></p>
<p>'Eusebeia'
is the outworking of new life.</p>
<p>It is
not the result of zeal for salvation.It
is the fruit of salvation.</p>
<p>Good
works are the evidence of new life.</p>
<p>They
should be evident in the lives of Christian women.1 Timothy 2:10'But (which becomes women professing
godliness 'eusebeia') with good works.'</p>
<p>'Eusebeia'
is profitable to all things.</p>
<p>Promise
of life in the present and life in the future.</p>
<p>1 Timothy
4:8For bodily exercise profits little:
but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that
now is, and of that which is to come.</p>
<p>This
does not mean that if we are godly then we are promised life now and in the
future.</p>
<p>We can
only be godly when we have new life.</p>
<p>Godliness
reveals the promise of new life in us right now and confirms the promise of
resurrected life in the future.</p>
<p><b>c)</b><b>Follow after godliness</b></p>
<p>1
Timothy 6:11But thou, O man of God,
flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love,
patience, meekness.</p>
<p>Follow righteousness - guarding our heart and mind from wrong desires.</p>
<p>Follow godliness - producing good works so Christ is seen in us.</p>
<p>Cultivating the fruit of the Spirit - led by the Spirit and putting off the works of the flesh.</p>
<h3>2. The
mystery of godliness (eusebeia).</h3>
<p>1 Timothy 3:16'And without controversy great is the mystery
of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of
angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into
glory.'</p>
<p>'Eusebeia'
is the outworking of a heart of worship.</p>
<p>It is
characterized by humility and love.</p>
<p>It
stands in contrast to pride and ambition.</p>
<p>The primary
concern of 'eusebeia' is not self interest but to glorify the Father, and
concern for the well being of others.</p>
<p><b>a)</b><b>The gospel message is called the 'mystery of eusebeia'.</b></p>
<p>The
primary objective of Christ was to glorify the Father. 'I have glorified you on
the earth: I have finished the work which you gave me to do.' (John 17:4)</p>
<p>The
Father sent His Son. </p>
<p>The Lord
Jesus came down to our level, and gave Himself as a sacrifice so that we can
become the sons and daughters of God.</p>
<p>i)God became flesh -
humanity of Christ</p>
<p>ii)Justified in the
Spirit - sinless Son of God</p>
<p>iii)Seen of angels - the
cross, resurrection and ascension.Crucified in weakness; raised in power.</p>
<p>Colossians 2:15'And having spoiled principalities and
powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.'</p>
<p>He has ascended far above
all.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:21'Far above all principality, and power, and
might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but
also in that which is to come:'.</p>
<p>iv)Preached unto the
Gentiles - the gospel message</p>
<p>v)Believed on in the
world - acceptance of the gospel.</p>
<p>vi)Received up into glory
- raised us up to be seated with Him in heavenly places.Heirs of God, joint heirs with Christ.</p>
<p>He
humbled Himself so that we can become sons and daughters of the living God
(Philippians 2:5-11).</p>
<p><b>b)</b><b>Following His example of 'eusebeia'</b></p>
<p>i)Christ was driven by
'agape' love not ambition. </p>
<p>We should be motivated by
'self sacrificing love'.</p>
<p>The love of God is not just
an emotional response to a bad situation.</p>
<p>God is love.Everything He does is a revelation of His
love.</p>
<p>Having loved His own, He
loved them unto the end (John 13:1).</p>
<p>'A new commandment I give unto
you, That you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one
another.' (John 13:34)</p>
<p>ii)The love of the Father
in us.</p>
<p>'And I have declared unto
them your name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith you have loved me
may be in them, and I in them.' (John 17:26).</p>
<p>His love is seen in that he
gave the most precious gift.</p>
<p>John 3:16 'For God so loved
the world'</p>
<p>Romans 8:32 'He that spared
not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him
also freely give us all things?'</p>
<p>How much more should we be
willing to give all for Him. (1 John 3:16)</p>
<p>iii)Christ delighted in obeying
the will of the Father.</p>
<p>He did nothing out of
duty.</p>
<p>He did everything out of love
for the Father.</p>
<p>Psalm 40:8'I delight to do your will, O my God: yea, your
law is within my heart.'</p>
<p>In Gethsemane He prayed 'not My
will but Yours be done' (Luke 22:42)</p>
<p>The life
of 'eusebeia' is expressed in this 'I delight to do your will' and 'not My will
but Yours be done'.</p>
<h3>3. Truth
and godliness (eusebeia).</h3>

<p>Titus
1:1Paul, a servant of God, and an
apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the
acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;</p>
<p>Acknowledging
(epignosis) means experiential knowledge.</p>
<p>Knowledge
of truth comes out of experience.</p>
<p>The
Bible says 'O taste and see that the Lord is good' (Psalm 34:8)</p>
<p><b>a)</b><b>Experiential knowledge of truth comes out of new life in
Christ.</b></p>
<p>'Then
said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If you continue in my word,
then are you my disciples indeed; And you
shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.' (John 8:31-32)</p>
<p>Remaining
steadfast in His word - badge of discipleship</p>
<p>Experiential
knowledge - freedom.</p>
<p>Freedom
results from remaining steadfast in the word of Christ.It is the product of 'eusebeia'</p>
<p>Bondage
comes from following self, sin, religion or secular philosophy.</p>
<p><b>b)</b><b>Doctrine must always be according to godliness 'eusebeia'.</b></p>
<p>1 Timothy
6:3If any man teach otherwise, and
consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to
the doctrine which is according to godliness;</p>
<p>Biblical
doctrine is known through 'experiential knowledge' of new life in Christ.</p>
<p>A church
that preaches doctrine and neglects 'eusebeia' is in error.</p>
<p>Doctrine
must be known through 'new life in Christ'.</p>
<p><b>Illustration:Truth must be experienced.</b></p>
<p>A major
reason why the Christian message is rejected is because the gospel is preached
as a doctrine to be believed rather than truth to be experienced.</p>
<p>The
preaching of 'experiential knowledge' will produce a far greater response
than merely preaching 'doctrinal truth'.</p>
<p>I have found this to be very evident when preaching in prisons. There is always a great response to the preaching of the gospel.</p>
<p>Jesus did not come to lecture doctrine; He came for this purpose that we might have life (John 10:10). The gospel of John was written for this purpose that we might know that Jesus is the Son of God and that by faith in Him we will find life (John 20:31).</p>
<p><b>c)</b><b>Not running after foolish teachings but seeking after godliness.</b><span>(1 Timothy 4:7) 'But
refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise yourself rather unto
godliness.'<b></b></span></p>
<p><b>The teaching that associates godliness with
the idea of being rich is foolish.</b></p>
<p>Living
in God's supernatural supply is a far greater blessing than an abundance of
riches.</p>
<p>Prosperity
is living in new life, and being content with the provision the Lord in our
daily lives. </p>
<p>(1
Timothy 6:6)'But godliness with
contentment is great gain.'</p>
<p>A godly
person may be blessed in business because he or she does everything with
diligence as unto the Lord.The teaching
that by giving a certain amount of money a person will receive a large
percentage return is wrong teaching.</p>
<p>Financial
abundance is never guaranteed in scripture.</p>
<p>The evidence
of new life is a godly character..</p>
<p>(1 Timothy
6:5)'Perverse disputings of men of
corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness:
from such withdraw thyself.'</p>
<p>Financial
stewardship of a Christian.</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> To provide for his or
her family (wife, children and aged parents if in need).</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> To care for the poor
especially those in the extended family and in our community. </p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> To provide for the
household of faith (those preaching the gospel)</p>
<p>There is
no scriptural obligation in the New Testament to give tithes to a local church.But it is necessary
to maintain a local church through the gifts of those who attend.These gifts need to be given cheerfully.</p>
<p>Preachers
who are lovers of money should be avoided.</p>
<p>A
preacher who lives on the donations of believers has a responsibility to live a
moderate lifestyle.</p>
<p>Preachers
who claim a special anointing or use cunningly devised teachings to raise large
amounts of money should be avoided.</p>
<p><b>Tax return on giving.</b></p>
<p>I have lived in Denmark for many years. The Danish tax system will give back tax on money that is given to the church. The figures have to be carefully documented. The problem with this system is that it can make giving very organised and systematic. It can also become legalistic and not the expression of worship.</p>
<p>Giving
should always come be joyful,an expression of love for Christ and for His people, and should come from a heart of worship and not legalistic duty.</p>
<p>Sometimes
an act of worship requires spontaneous giving with no regard to tax
return.</p>
<h3>4. The
building of Christian character.</h3>

<p>'And beside this, giving all diligence, add to
your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience
godliness; And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness
charity.' (2 Peter 1:5-7)</p>
<p><b>The greatest testimony of the believer is the
life of the believer.</b></p>
<p>What we
are in daily life speaks much more than what we preach to others.</p>
<p>It is
the life of Christ in the believer that will attract people to Christ.</p>
<p>We can
preach words but the testimony of our life is our message.</p>
<p>But we
are not judged by man's standards.</p>
<p>Our goal
is to come to the full stature of Christ. (Ephesians 4:13)</p>
<p><b>The need to increase in godly character. </b></p>
<p>Our
character should become stronger in steadfast endurance.</p>
<p>We
should be seen to be more Christlike in our daily lives as His life in us
increases.</p>
<p>Our
relationship with others should be seen to increase in kindness and
consideration of others.</p>
<p>All
things controlled by 'agape' love.</p>
<p><b>Religious hypocrisy - built upon morality and
legalism not the life of Christ </b></p>
<p>(2 Timothy
3:5)'Having a form of godliness, but
denying the power thereof: from such turn away.'</p>
<p>Nominal
Christians who do not have the life of Christ have religion not life.</p>
<p>The
Christian life is no more than 'living a good life'</p>
<p>It is
the life of Christ in us that will produce the fruit of a godly life.</p>
<p>Morality
and legalism cannot produce new life.</p>
<h3>5. Seeking
'eusebeia' in the knowledge that the world will pass away.</h3>

<p><span>Living
for eternity.<b></b>(2 Peter 3:11)'Seeing then that all these things shall be
dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and
godliness.'<b></b></span></p>
<p>i)The world will not
endure.'Seeing then that all these
things shall be dissolved...' (2 Peter 3:11)</p>
<p>Peter tells how the earth
will one day be destroyed.</p>
<p>This is proven by science.</p>
<p>The sun is burning hydrogen
and gives off helium.</p>
<p>When the sun begins to burn
helium then the heat will be immense and the planets in the solar system will
be destroyed by fire.</p>
<p>ii)'Eusebeia' will
endure.'...what manner of persons ought
ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness.' (2 Peter 3:11)</p>
<p><i>Anastrophe</i> - conversation
'manner of life'</p>
<p><i>Eusebeia</i> - Godliness</p>
<p>Glorify the Lord with our
lives.</p>
<p>Motivated by the love of Christ.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>'Eusebeia'...</p>
<p>1)...is the outworking of the life of Christ in us.</p>
<p>2)...was at the heart of the redemptive work of Christ 'the mystery of godliness'. It should be seen leading the life of the believer as 'eusebeia' was seen leading
Christ.</p>
<p>3)...it is never legalistic but evidence of the freedom we have in Christ.</p>
<p>4)...it is produced by growth in the Christian life.</p>
<p>5)...it is a life of worship.</p>
<p>6)...it will bring an eternal
inheritance.</p>
