<h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2">Isaac Sharp and Asbjorn Kloster in the Faroe Islands (April June 1862)</h4>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Journal of Isaac Sharp - May 13, 1862</p>
<h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Videreidi</h3>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Left Thorshaven(Torshavn)a little before one; the weather bright and sunny. On rounding the points of land to the south-east of Osteroe(Eysturoy), the currents were very rapid, and for a little space we were tossed exceedingly. The high and rugged mountain steeps, as we passed Klaksvig(Klaksvik), reminded me more of Iceland than anything we have before seen in Faroe. We had a rapid sail up the Sound between Kunoe(Kunoy)and BoroeBordoy, and after a fine passage of five hours and a quarter, landed at Videroe(Videreidi), the residence of the pastor within whose district the North East Isles lie.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Our kind hostess of Thorshaven(Torshavn)embraced the opportunity offered by our voyage of going on a visit to Videroe(Videreidi), and doubtless this little circumstance helped us considerably, as we found on landing, the pastor was from home, and his wife, in his absence, was busy with her maidens, who were in the midst of the "spring cleaning." The windows had been taken out of their frames, and the household furniture in general was much in the condition it is wont to be under such circumstances. Simultaneously, the girls ceased their work, and looked on the two foreigners with no little amazement. Our arrival was announced, and the mention of the foregoing will help to show how great was the kindness in giving a hearty welcome to the strangers who had so unexpectedly arrived. The pastor's wife speaks English fluently, having resided for some years in the West Indies. A bountiful repast was quickly prepared forus,and a bed for each. Striking was the contrast between the humble exterior of this dwelling and the elegance within. After tea I took a little walk up the hill side and enjoyed the view. Below was the ocean like a tranquil lake-mountains rose right and left, with a wonderfully rugged outline flecked with snow, the little valley lying between affording a larger extent of pasture ground than is often seen inFaroe.The present pastor and his wife have resided at Videroe(Videreidi)about three years. The latter gave me an instance of the difficulties attendant on the isolation of these far-off islands. A marriage was about to takeplace,and a boat and crew came one stormy morning for the minister. The storm increased as, with a gaze of intense anxiety, his wife, after they had left, watched the frail bark, which repeatedly disappeared and then rose again, until at length it could be seen no more. Chilled by the storm, her heart sank within her, as from one to another the fear quickly spread that her husband had found a watery grave. Ordinarily, the journey was one of three hours; in the present case it was eventide before they were able to land, and three days before the pastor was able to return. It then became his lot to nurse his wife, who for a month was confined to her bed, and so ill as scarcely to afford a hope of her recovery; the nearest medical aid being at Thorshaven(Torshavn), distant there and back a full day's journey.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Feeling my mind much drawn towards Fugloe(Fugloy), inquiries were made for a boat and the best time for starting. Our guide said, "I suppose you will not go if the weather is not fine?" "We will go when the crew and the boat can go," respondedAsbjornKloster. "That is good," said the man. "But you must not go without your breakfast," said the mistress of the household, "and it shall be ready for you at seven in the morning."</p>
