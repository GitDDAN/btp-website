<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">By and large they gave an accurate account of the events that took place
in their towns and villages. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">One national paper carried the statement that pipes, tobacco, tobacco
pouches and cigarettes were placed in a given spot in the middle of the
villages of <span class="SpellE">Cairnbulg</span> and <span class="SpellE">Inverall­ochy</span>.The articles concerned were then set alight
in bonfire style and the converts sang hymns and prayed, but as far as I have
endeavoured to trace this event, I have been unable to find anyone to
corroborate it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In the Christian press coverage was given to the revival and reports
show that Professors and Ministers had to acknow­ledge that it was "of

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"The prairie fire of religious revival is raging along the coasts
from Wick to Peterhead. It was kindled by a torch lit at </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Yarmouth</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> and </span><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Lowestoft</span></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">. It is filling the Kirks and
emptying the pubs. 'We came back with <span class="SpellE">nae</span> <span class="SpellE">muckle</span> <span class="SpellE">siller</span>, but with saved
souls,' is the frequent remark made. Is there any new message? 1 asked. 'No,
just the old, old story, but the preaching has power.' They speak
affectionately of Jock and </span><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Douglas</span></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB"> meaning their leaders. Jock Troup a herring cooper from Wick and the
Rev. A. Douglas Brown a Baptist minister from </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">London</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB">. While having dinner one Sunday
aboard a herring drifter Jock Troup said, 'We're going to have a revival, we
must pray and then go out and get it.' This they did, they knelt on the floor
of the cabin and cried to God, then went ashore and held the first of many
open-air meetings in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Yarmouth</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB">. It is obvious that PRAYER AND
CONFIDENCE ARE THE WEAPONS WITH WHICH THIS </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">BATTLE</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> IS BEING FOUGHT.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Meetings started in the open-air, <span class="GramE">then</span> the
churches opened their door and hundreds professed salvation. 'It won't last
long,' they said, but the <span class="SpellE">fisherfolks</span> are home from </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">East Anglia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span lang="EN-GB"> and in every port they are

were tremendous.There
was the hardened character who threatened his wife with a razor, who got <span class="GramE">converted</span> arid then his wife followed him. Then there was

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"People are thronging the streets going to <span class="GramE">Church,</span>
nine out of ten can be counted on being bound for a place of worship. They are
not the conventional type of Churchgoer. With them religion is part of
themselves, not to be confused with the donning of fine raiment. So one
discovers them in the garb of their calling, the men in blue jerseys and caps,
the women in shawls, but there are <span class="GramE">well-dressed people
sprinkled amongst them, which shows</span> that the movement is not confined to
only the fisher class. Where the church should hold 500, a 1000 or more
contrive to find an entry and the doorway is blocked with others who would fain
get in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">There is no waiting .for the fixed hour for the beginning. Prayer is
offered spontaneously -without a break, the worship switches again into hymn
choruses. Voluntary testimonies are frankly and eagerly made by young
converts." Tales of drink and gambling, of domestic unhappiness, of soured
existence, flow from the lips of men and women who passionately" plead
with the unconverted. The messages are simple. <span class="GramE">there</span>
is insistence on one point - the acceptance of Christ as the only road to
salvation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Figures in tens and twenties move down the aisles of places of worship
to prostrate themselves at the stool of repentance. More come to increase the
number of motionless figures at the front. It is an experience that sends a
thrill through you veins. The people refuse to leave the building, and once
more the singing breaks out, as full-throated as ever.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The villages along the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span lang="EN-GB">Moray</span></st1:placename><st1:placetype><span lang="EN-GB">Coast</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB"> are moved by the revival. Each
centre is sending out groups of God-fearing sturdy fishermen as day
missionaries to the immediate neighbourhood, which in turn follows the same
course. By cycle and foot without regard to weather they make their pilgrimage.
They are triumphant heroes of the Cross of Christ with its meaning and message.
Everywhere at home and in the streets there is joyous singing of hymns such <span class="GramE">as .</span> <span class="GramE">At the cross where I first saw the
Light'.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">'We are not revolting against the churches', says Jock 'But the Almighty
is.' The ministers have left the Bible to a new theology which is not based on
the Bible. God has lowly and humble instruments .to .guide people back to the
truth which is in Christ. It is a revelation to hear the songs sung in the
Spirit."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

meets the eye of the casual observer for men and women, young and old have been
swept off their feet in 1000' s as the movement has swept up the seaboard of
the Aberdeenshire Coast. Life has been radically changed, and the old
valuations are gone. Something big and overwhelming has happened to them, and

gatherings are mostly acts of praise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"The meetings in the Salvation Army Hall continue with marked
success with many wonderful conversions taking place. Several fish­ermen
converts have left for West Coast fishing. On boat, the <span class="SpellE">Mizpah</span>
is manned entirely by men who have professed Christianity, and their departure
last week for the <span class="SpellE">Stornoway</span> fishing was a scene of
great interest at the harbour. The boat sailed with the Salvat­ion Army flag
flying from her masthead and the crew and their friends sang revival hymns. It
was really a scene unexampled in the history of the </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span lang="EN-GB">Port</span></st1:placetype><span lang="EN-GB"> of </span><st1:placename><span lang="EN-GB">Wick</span></st1:placename></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The boat was stormbound at <span class="SpellE">Scrabster</span> and the
crew went to <span class="SpellE">Thurso</span> Salvation Army and held meetings
where a number professed conversion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The meetings continue in Zion Salvation Army Hall, and the work shows no
sign of abatement. Of late the parents of young fisher­men have been following
their offspring into the </span><st1:street><st1:address><span lang="EN-GB">Narrow Way</span></st1:address></st1:street><span lang="EN-GB">;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"David <span class="SpellE">Cordiner</span> does not mention his
experiences at Peterhead very often - he is afraid lest people think he is <span class="GramE">a somebody</span>, when he knows, 'Jesus did it all'. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">He was in the fishing fleet at </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Yarmouth</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> along with Jock Troup when the
revival broke out there. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">He had to bear the hardships of the poor fishing that was exper­ienced
when the fleet went out day after day and often returned with hardly a fish.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Jock Troup heard the voice of God in the trouble and began open-air
meetings, at which David stood as a listener. David had been converted some two
years previously, but had never come right out for God. One night, however, he
faced the matter, and he felt within him a great deliverance had come. Now he
could take part in the meetings, and began by bringing his mates and the <span class="SpellE">fishergirls</span> to the meetings, and many were saved. Soon the
boats turned home once more to </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Scotland</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span lang="EN-GB">, and when he reached Peterhead, and
went home to his father's house, he felt a heavy burden of responsibility upon
his soul.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">One Saturday night he was compelled to go along to the corner where the
men usually gathered. He had never preached before, and had neither heads nor
tails to his address; but the Lord filled his mouth with words, and soon a
crowd gathered. For nearly two hours David held on his burning appeal. <span class="GramE">That night seven men came out and knelt down on the stones of the
street, confessing their sin and committing themselves to the Saviour.</span>
Next day, Sunday, was a day usually spent mostly in prayer. When night came, he
went forth again to the street, and again a crowd gather­ed. The night was
cold, and after a time a march was formed, and the crowd went into the
Salvation Army Hall. Here a great scene was witnessed, when over twenty anxious
souls sought the Saviour.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">For six weeks meetings went on every night, David bearing the greater
share of the work, but others also came to help, and hun­dreds professed
decision for Christ. Some news of this movement reached us in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Glasgow</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB">, and on the first Saturday of the
New Year of 1922, I went to </span><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Falkirk</span></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB"> for the weekend, to help Mr. Currie, of the
Town Mission, who was Chairman of our Newton St. Boswells Branch at one time.
At <span class="SpellE">Larbert</span> I met a friend who said to me, 'Have you
heard that David <span class="SpellE">Cordiner</span> has come to </span><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Falkirk</span></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">?' I said, 'No.' 'Well he is to take
part in the meetings at the Town Mission this weekend.' I was delighted to hear
it, and went on the </span><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Falkirk</span></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB"> with keen expectations. Mr. Currie met me, and told me about David <span class="SpellE">Cordiner's</span> arrival, and that he had come without being
asked, and<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="GramE"><span lang="EN-GB">that</span></span><span lang="EN-GB">, whilst he would take part in the meetings, I
must also take part. We went to the Mission Hall and knelt down in the vestry
to pray. While we were kneeling, the door opened, and someone knelt<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="GramE"><span lang="EN-GB">down</span></span><span lang="EN-GB"> near me, and I knew it was David <span class="SpellE">Cordiner</span>. When we got up from our knees, I shook hands with
this serious-faced young man. I said, 'You will take the meeting tonight?' 'No,
you must fulfil your programme,' he said."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
