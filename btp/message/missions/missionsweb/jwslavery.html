<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">  (1) <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">1.</span> By slavery, I mean domestic <span class="GramE">slavery,</span> or that of a servant to a master. A late ingenious
writer well observes, "The variety of forms in which slavery appears, makes
it almost impossible to convey a just notion of it, by way of definition. There
are, however, certain properties which have accompanied slavery in most places,
whereby it is easily distinguished from that mild, domestic service which
obtains in our country."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">2.</span> Slavery imports an obligation of
perpetual service, an obligation which only the consent of the master can dissolve.
Neither in some countries can the master himself dissolve it, without the
consent of Judges appointed by the law. It generally gives the master an
arbitrary power of any correction, not affecting life or limb. Sometimes even
these are exposed to his will, or protected only by a fine, or some slight
punishment, too inconsiderable to restrain a master of a harsh temper. It
creates <span class="GramE">an incapacity</span> of acquiring anything, except
for the master's benefit. It allows the master to alienate the same, in the same
manner as his cows and horses. Lastly, it descends in its full extent from
parent to child, even to the last generation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">3.</span> The beginning of this may be dated
from the remotest period of which we have an account in history. It commenced
in the barbarous state of society, and in process of time spread into all
nations. It prevailed particularly among the Jews, the Greeks, the Romans, and
the ancient Germans; and was transmitted by them to the various kingdoms and
states which arose out of the </span><span lang="EN-US">Roman Empire</span><span lang="EN-US" style="color:black">. But after Christianity prevailed, it gradually fell into
decline in almost all parts of </span><span lang="EN-US">Europe</span><span lang="EN-US" style="color:black">. This great change began in </span><span lang="EN-US">Spain</span><span lang="EN-US">, about the end of the eighth century; and was
become general in most other kingdoms of </span><span lang="EN-US">Europe</span><span lang="EN-US" style="color:black">, before the middle of the fourteenth. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">4.</span> From this time slavery was nearly
extinct till the commencement of the sixteenth century, when the discovery of </span><span lang="EN-US">America</span><span lang="EN-US">, and of the western and eastern coasts of </span><span lang="EN-US">Africa</span><span lang="EN-US" style="color:black">, gave occasion to the revival of it. It took its rise from
the Portuguese, who, to supply the Spaniards with men to cultivate their new
possessions in </span><span lang="EN-US">America</span><span lang="EN-US">, procured Negroes from </span><span lang="EN-US">Africa</span><span lang="EN-US" style="color:black">, whom they sold for slaves to the American Spaniards. This
began in the year 1508, when they imported the first Negroes into </span><span lang="EN-US">Hispaniola</span><span lang="EN-US" style="color:black">. In 1540, Charles the Fifth, then King of Spain,
determined to put an end to Negro slavery<span class="GramE">; giving</span>
positive orders that all the Negro slaves in the Spanish dominions should be
set free. And this was accordingly done by <span class="SpellE">Lagasca</span>,
whom he sent and empowered to free them all, on condition of continuing to <span class="SpellE">labour</span> for their masters. <span class="GramE">But soon after <span class="SpellE">Lagasca</span> returned to </span></span><span class="GramE"><span lang="EN-US">Spain</span></span><span class="GramE"><span lang="EN-US">, slavery returned and
flourished as before.</span></span><span lang="EN-US">
Afterwards, other nations, as they acquired possessions in </span><span lang="EN-US">America</span><span lang="EN-US">, followed the examples of the Spaniards; and
slavery has taken deep root in most of our American colonies. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="color:black"><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   (2)<span> Such is the
nature of slavery; such the beginning of Negro slavery in </span></span><span lang="EN-US">America</span><span lang="EN-US">. But some may desire to know what kind of
country it is from which the Negroes are brought; what sort of men, of what
temper and <span class="SpellE">behaviour</span> are they in their own country;
and in what manner they are generally procured, carried to, and treated in,
America. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">1</span>. And, First, what kind of country is
that from whence they are brought? Is it so remarkably horrid, dreary, and
barren, that it is a kindness to deliver them out of it? I believe many have
apprehended so; but it is an entire mistake, if we may give credit to those who
have lived many years therein, and could have no motive to misrepresent it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">2.</span> That part of </span><span lang="EN-US">Africa</span><span lang="EN-US" style="color:black"> whence the Negroes are brought, commonly known by the name
of </span><span lang="EN-US">Guinea</span><span lang="EN-US">, extends along the coast, in the whole, between
three and four thousand miles. From the river </span><span lang="EN-US">Senegal</span><span lang="EN-US">, seventeen degrees north of the line, to </span><span lang="EN-US">Cape <span style="color:windowtext">Sierra-Leone</span>,<span> it
contains seven hundred miles. Thence it runs eastward about fifteen hundred
miles, including the Grain Coast, the Ivory Coast, the Gold Coast, and the
Slave Coast, with the large kingdom of Benin. From thence it runs southward,
about twelve hundred miles, and contains the kingdoms of </span></span><span lang="EN-US">Congo</span><span lang="EN-US"> and </span><span lang="EN-US">Angola</span><span lang="EN-US">. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">3.</span> Concerning the first, the </span><span lang="EN-US">Senegal</span><span lang="EN-US"> coast, Monsieur <span class="SpellE">Brue</span>,
who lived there sixteen years, after describing its fruitfulness near the sea,
says, "The farther you go from the sea, the more fruitful and
well-improved is the country, abounding in pulse, Indian corn, and various
fruits. Here are vast meadows, which feed large herds of great and small
cattle; and the villages, which lie thick, show the country is well
peopled." And again: "I was surprised to see the land so well
cultivated: Scarce a spot lay unimproved; the low lands, divided by small
canals, were all sowed with rice; the higher grounds were planted with Indian
corn, and peas of different sorts. Their beef is excellent; poultry plenty, and
very cheap, as are all the necessaries of life." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">4.</span> As to the Grain and </span><span lang="EN-US">Ivory Coast</span><span lang="EN-US">, we learn from eye-witnesses, that the soil is
in general fertile, producing abundance of rice and roots. Indigo and cotton
thrive without cultivation; fish is in great plenty; the flocks and herds are
numerous, and the trees <span class="SpellE">loaden</span> with fruit. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">5.</span> The Gold Coast and </span><span lang="EN-US">Slave Coast</span><span lang="EN-US" style="color:black">, all who have seen it agree, is exceeding fruitful and
pleasant, producing vast quantities of rice and other grain, plenty of fruit
and roots, palm wine and oil, and fish in great abundance, with much tame and
wild cattle. The very same account is given us of the soil and produce of the
kingdoms of </span><span lang="EN-US">Benin</span><span lang="EN-US">, </span><span lang="EN-US">Congo</span><span lang="EN-US">, and </span><span lang="EN-US">Angola</span><span lang="EN-US">. From all which it appears, that </span><span lang="EN-US">Guinea</span><span lang="EN-US">, in general, is far from <span class="GramE">an</span>
horrid, dreary, barren country, -- is one of the most fruitful, as well as the
most pleasant, countries in the known world. It is said indeed to be unhealthy;
and so it is to strangers, but perfectly healthy to the native inhabitants. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">6.</span> Such is the country from which the
Negroes are brought. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   We come next to
inquire what sort of men they are, of what temper and <span class="SpellE">behaviour</span>,
not in our plantations; but in their native country. And here likewise the
surest way is to take our account from eye and ear witnesses. Now, those who
have lived in the </span><span lang="EN-US">Senegal</span><span lang="EN-US"> country observe, it is inhabited by three
nations, the <span class="SpellE">Jalofs</span>, <span class="SpellE">Fulis</span>,
and Mandingos. The King of the <span class="SpellE">Jalofs</span> has under him
several Ministers, who assist in the exercise of justice. The Chief Justice
goes in circuit through all his dominions, to hear complaints and determine
controversies; and the Viceroy goes with him, to inspect the <span class="SpellE">behaviour</span> of the <span class="SpellE">Alkadi</span>, or
Governor, of each village. The <span class="SpellE">Fulis</span> are governed by
their chief men, who rule with much moderation. Few of them will drink anything
stronger than water, being strict <span class="SpellE">Mahometans</span>. The
Government is easy, because the people are of a quiet and good disposition, and
so well instructed in what is right, that a man who wrongs another is the
abomination of all. They desire no more land than they use, which they
cultivate with great care and industry: If any of them are known to be made
slaves by the white men, they all join to redeem them. They not only support
all that are old, or blind, or lame among themselves, but have frequently
supplied the necessities of the Mandingos, when they were distressed by famine.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">7.</span> "The Mandingos," says
Monsieur <span class="SpellE">Brue</span>, "are rigid <span class="SpellE">Mahometans</span>,
drinking neither wine nor brandy. They are industrious and laborious, keeping
their ground well cultivated, and breeding a good stock of cattle. Every town
has a Governor, and he appoints the <span class="SpellE">labour</span> of the
people. The men work the ground designed for corn; the women and girls, the rice-ground.
He afterwards divides the corn and rice among them; and decides all quarrels,
if any arise. All the <span class="SpellE">Mahometan</span> Negroes constantly go
to public prayers thrice a day; there being a Priest in every village, who
regularly calls them together; and it is surprising to see the modesty,
attention, and reverence which they observe during their worship. These three
nations <span class="SpellE">practise</span> several trades; they have smiths,
saddlers, potters, and weavers; and they are very ingenious at their several
occupations. Their smiths not only make all the instruments of iron which they
have <span class="GramE">occasion</span> to use, but likewise work many things
neatly in gold and silver. It is chiefly the women and children who weave fine
cotton cloth, which they dye blue and black." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">8.</span> It was of these parts of Guinea
that Monsieur <span class="SpellE">Allanson</span>, correspondent of the Royal
Academy of Sciences at Paris, from 1749 to 1753, gives the following account,
both as to the country and people: -- "Which way <span class="SpellE">soever</span>
I turned my eyes, I beheld a perfect image of pure nature: An agreeable
solitude, bounded on every side by a charming landscape; the rural situation of
cottages in the midst of trees; the ease and quietness of the Negroes, reclined
under the shade of the spreading foliage, with the simplicity of their dress
and manners: The whole revived in my mind the idea of our first parents, and I
seemed to contemplate the world in its primitive state. They are, generally
speaking, very good-natured, sociable, and obliging. I was not a little pleased
with my very first reception; and it fully convinced me, that there ought to be
a considerable abatement made in the accounts we have of the savage character
of the Africans." He adds: "It is amazing that an illiterate people
should reason so pertinently concerning the heavenly bodies. There is no doubt,
but that, with proper instruments, they would become excellent
astronomers." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">9.</span> The inhabitants of the Grain and </span><span lang="EN-US">Ivory Coast</span><span lang="EN-US"> are represented by those that deal with them,
as sensible, courteous, and the fairest traders on the coasts of </span><span lang="EN-US">Guinea</span><span lang="EN-US">. They rarely drink to excess; if any do, they
are severely punished by the King's order. They are seldom troubled with war:
If <span class="GramE">a difference happen</span> between two nations, they
commonly end the dispute amicably. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   The inhabitants of the
Gold and </span><span lang="EN-US">Slave Coast</span><span lang="EN-US"> likewise, when they are not artfully incensed
against each other, live in great union and friendship, being generally
well-tempered, civil, tractable, and ready to help any that need it. In
particular, the natives of the </span><span lang="EN-US">kingdom</span><span lang="EN-US"> of </span><span class="SpellE"><span lang="EN-US">Whidah</span></span><span lang="EN-US"> are civil, kind, and obliging to strangers; and
they are the most gentleman-like of all the Negroes, abounding in good manners
toward each other. The inferiors pay the utmost respect to their superiors; so
wives to their husbands, children to their parents. And they are remarkably
industrious; all are constantly employed, -- the men in agriculture, the women
in spinning and weaving cotton. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">10.</span> The Gold and </span><span lang="EN-US">Slave</span><span lang="EN-US"> </span><span lang="EN-US">Coasts</span><span lang="EN-US"> are divided into several districts, some
governed by Kings, others by the principal men, who take care each of their own
town or village, and prevent or appease tumults. They punish murder and
adultery severely; very frequently with death. Theft and robbery are punished
by a fine <span class="SpellE">proportionable</span> to the goods that were
taken. All the natives of this coast, though Heathens, believe there is one
God, the Author of them and all things. They appear likewise to have a confused
apprehension of a future state. And, accordingly, every town and village has a
place of public worship. It is remarkable that they have no beggars among them;
such is the care of the chief men, in every city and village, to provide some
easy <span class="SpellE">labour</span> even for the old and weak. Some are
employed in blowing the smiths' bellows; others in pressing palm-oil; others in
grinding of <span class="SpellE">colours</span>. If they are too weak even for
this, they sell provisions in the market. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">11.</span> The natives of the </span><span lang="EN-US">kingdom</span><span lang="EN-US"> of </span><span lang="EN-US">Benin</span><span lang="EN-US" style="color:black"> are a reasonable and good-natured people. They are sincere
and inoffensive, and do no injustice either to one another or to strangers.
They are eminently civil and courteous: If you make them a present, they <span class="SpellE">endeavour</span> to repay it double; and if they are trusted till
the ship returns the next year, they are sure honestly to pay the whole debt.
Theft is punished among them, although not with the same severity as murder. If
a man and woman of any quality are taken in adultery, they are certain to be
put to death, and their bodies thrown on a dunghill, and left a prey to wild
beasts. They are punctually just and honest in their dealings; and are also
very charitable, the King and the great Lords taking care to employ all that
are capable of any work. And those that are utterly helpless they keep for
God's sake; so that here also are no beggars. The inhabitants of </span><span lang="EN-US">Congo</span><span lang="EN-US"> and </span><span lang="EN-US">Angola</span><span lang="EN-US"> are generally a quiet people. They discover a
good understanding, and behave in a friendly manner to strangers, being of a
mild temper and an affable carriage. Upon the whole, therefore, the Negroes who
inhabit the coast of Africa, from the river Senegal to the southern bounds of
Angola, are so far from being the stupid, senseless, brutish, lazy barbarians,
the fierce, cruel, perfidious savages they have been described, that, on the
contrary, they are represented, by them who have no motive to flatter them, as remarkably
sensible, considering the few advantages they have for improving their
understanding; as industrious to the highest degree, perhaps more so than any
other natives of so warm a climate; as fair, just, and honest in all their
dealings, unless where white men have taught them to be otherwise; and as far
more mild, friendly, and kind to strangers, than any of our forefathers were. <i>Our
forefathers!</i> Where shall we find at this day, among the fair-faced natives
of </span><span lang="EN-US">Europe</span><span lang="EN-US">, a nation generally <span class="SpellE">practising</span>
the justice, mercy, and truth, which are found among these poor Africans?
Suppose the preceding accounts are true, (which I see no reason or pretence to
doubt of,) and we may leave </span><span lang="EN-US">England</span><span lang="EN-US"> and </span><span lang="EN-US">France</span><span lang="EN-US">, to seek genuine honesty in </span><span lang="EN-US">Benin</span><span lang="EN-US">, </span><span lang="EN-US">Congo</span><span lang="EN-US">, or </span><span lang="EN-US">Angola</span><span lang="EN-US">. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">(3) We have now seen what kind of
country it is from which the Negroes are brought; and what sort of men (even
white men being the judges) they were in their own country. Inquire we,
Thirdly, <span class="GramE">In</span> what manner are they generally procured,
carried to, and treated in, </span><span lang="EN-US">America</span><span lang="EN-US">. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">1.</span> First. In what manner are they
procured? <span class="GramE">Part of them by fraud.</span> Captains of ships,
from time to time, have invited Negroes to come on board, and then carried them
away. But far more have been procured by force. <span class="GramE">The
Christians, landing upon their coasts, seized as many as they found, men,
women, and children, and transported them to </span></span><span class="GramE"><span lang="EN-US">America</span></span><span class="GramE"><span lang="EN-US">.</span></span><span lang="EN-US"> It was about 1551 that the English began
trading to </span><span lang="EN-US">Guinea</span><span lang="EN-US">; at first, for gold and elephants' teeth; but
soon after, for men. In 1556, Sir John Hawkins sailed with two ships to </span><span lang="EN-US">Cape</span><span lang="EN-US"> </span><span class="SpellE"><span lang="EN-US">Verd</span></span><span lang="EN-US">, where he sent eighty men on shore to catch
Negroes. But the natives flying, they fell farther down, and there set the men
on shore, "to burn their towns and take the inhabitants." But they
met with such resistance, that they had seven men killed, and took but ten
Negroes. So they went still farther down, till, having taken enough, they
proceeded to the </span><span lang="EN-US">West
 Indies</span><span lang="EN-US"> and sold them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">2.</span> It was some time before the
Europeans found a more compendious way of procuring African slaves, by
prevailing upon them to make war upon each other, and to sell their prisoners.
Till then they seldom had any wars; but were in general quiet and peaceable.
But the white men first taught them drunkenness and avarice, and then hired
them to sell one another. Nay, by this means, even their Kings are induced to
sell their own subjects. So Mr. Moore, factor of the African Company in 1730,
informs us: "When the King of <span class="SpellE">Barsalli</span> wants
goods or brandy, he sends to the English Governor at James's Fort, who
immediately sends a sloop. Against the time it arrives, he plunders some of his
<span class="SpellE">neighbours</span>' towns, selling the people for the goods
he wants. At other times he falls upon one of his own towns, and makes bold to
sell his own subjects." So Monsieur <span class="SpellE">Brue</span> says,
"I wrote to the King," (not the same,) "if he had a sufficient
number of slaves, I would treat with him. He seized three hundred of his own
people, and sent word he was ready to deliver them for the goods." He
adds: "Some of the natives are always ready" (when well paid)
"to surprise and carry off their own countrymen. They come at night
without noise, and if they find any lone cottage, surround it and carry off all
the people." <span class="SpellE">Barbot</span>, another French factor,
says, "Many of the slaves sold by the Negroes are prisoners of war, or
taken in the incursions they make into their enemies' territories. Others are
stolen. Abundance of little Blacks, of both sexes, are stolen away by their <span class="SpellE">neighbours</span>, when found abroad on the road, or in the woods,
or else in the corn-fields, at the time of year when their parents keep them
there all day to scare away the devouring birds." That their own parents
sell them is utterly false: Whites, not Blacks, are without natural affection! <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">3.</span> To set the manner wherein Negroes
are procured in a yet stronger light, it will suffice to give an extract of
"Two Voyages to </span><span lang="EN-US">Guinea</span><span lang="EN-US">" on this account. The first is taken
verbatim from the original manuscript of the Surgeon's Journal: -- <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   "<span class="SpellE">Sestro</span>, </span><st1:date day="29" month="12" year="1724"><span lang="EN-US">Dec. 29, 1724</span></st1:date><span lang="EN-US">. -- No trade to-day, though many traders came
on board. They informed us, that the people are gone to war within land, and
will bring prisoners enough in two or three days; in hopes of which we stay. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span class="GramE">"The
30th.</span> -- No trade yet; but our traders came on board to-day, and informed
us the people had burnt four towns; so that to-morrow we expect slaves off. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span class="GramE">"The
31st. -- Fair weather; but no trading yet.</span> We see each night towns
burning. But we hear many of the <span class="SpellE">Sestro</span> men are
killed by the inland Negroes; so that we fear this war will be unsuccessful. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   "The 2nd of
January. -- Last night we saw a prodigious fire break out about eleven o'clock,
and this morning see the town of <span class="SpellE">Sestro</span> burned down
to the ground." (It contained some hundred houses.) "So that we find
their enemies are too hard for them at present, and consequently our trade
spoiled here. Therefore about </span><st1:time hour="7" minute="0"><span lang="EN-US">seven o'clock</span></st1:time><span lang="EN-US"> we weighed anchor, to <span class="GramE">proceed</span>
lower down."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">4.</span> The second extract, taken from the
Journal of a Surgeon, who went from </span><st1:state><span lang="EN-US">New York</span></st1:state><span lang="EN-US"> on the same trade, is as follows: "The
commander of the vessel sent to acquaint the King, that he wanted a cargo of
slaves. The King promised to furnish him; and, in order to it, set out,
designing to surprise some town, and make all the people prisoners. Some time
after, the King sent him word, he had not yet met with the desired success;
having attempted to break up two towns, but having been twice repulsed; but
that he still hoped to procure the number of slaves. In this design he
persisted, till he met his enemies in the field. A battle was fought, which
lasted three days. And the engagement was so bloody, that four thousand five
hundred men were slain upon the spot." Such is the manner wherein the
Negroes are procured! Thus the Christians preach the Gospel to the Heathens! <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">5.</span> Thus they are procured. But in what
numbers and in what manner are they carried to </span><span lang="EN-US">America</span><span lang="EN-US">? Mr. Anderson, in his <i>History of Trade and
Commerce</i>, observes: "England supplies her American colonies with Negro
slaves, amounting in number to about an hundred thousand every year;" that
is, so many are taken on board our ships; but at least ten thousand of them die
in the voyage; about a fourth part more die at the different islands, in what
is called the seasoning. So that at an average, in the passage and seasoning
together, thirty thousand die; that is, properly, are murdered. O Earth, O Sea,
cover not thou their blood! <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">6.</span> When they are brought down to the
shore in order to be sold, our Surgeons thoroughly examine them, and that quite
naked, women and men, without any distinction; those that are approved are set
on one side. In the mean time, a burning-iron, with the arms or name of the
company, lies in the fire, with which they are marked on the breast. Before
they are put into the ships, their masters strip them of all they have on their
backs: So that they come on board stark naked, women as well as men. It is
common for several hundred of them to be put on board one vessel, where they
are stowed together in as little room as it is possible for them to be crowded.
It is easy to suppose what a condition they must soon be in, between heat,
thirst, and stench of various kinds. So that it is no wonder, so many should
die in the passage; but rather, that any survive it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">7. </span>When the vessels arrive at their
destined port, the Negroes are again exposed naked to the eyes of all that
flock together, and the examination of their purchasers. Then they are
separated to the plantations of their several masters, to see each other no
more. Here you may see mothers hanging over their daughters, bedewing their
naked breasts with tears, and daughters clinging to their parents, till the <span class="SpellE">whipper</span> soon obliges them to part. And what can be more
wretched than the condition they then enter upon? Banished from their country,
from their friends and relations for ever, from every comfort of life, they are
reduced to a state scarce anyway preferable to that of beasts of burden. In
general, a few roots, not of the nicest kind, usually yams or potatoes, are their
food; and two rags, that neither <span class="GramE">screen</span> them from the
heat of the day, nor the cold of the night, their covering. Their sleep is very
short, their <span class="SpellE">labour</span> continual, and frequently above
their strength; so that death sets many of them at liberty before they have
lived out half their days. The time they work in the West Indies, is from
day-break to noon, and from two o'clock till dark; during which time, they are
attended by overseers, who, if they think them dilatory, or think anything not
so well done as it should be, whip them most unmercifully, so that you may see
their bodies long after <span class="SpellE">wealed</span> and scarred usually
from the shoulders to the waist. And before they are suffered to go to their
quarters, they have commonly something to do, as collecting herbage for the
horses, or gathering fuel for the boilers; so that it is often past twelve
before they can get home. Hence, if their food is not prepared, they are
sometimes called to <span class="SpellE">labour</span> again, before they can
satisfy their hunger. And no excuse will avail. If they are not in the field
immediately, they must expect to feel the lash. Did the Creator intend that the
noblest creatures in the visible world should live such a life as this? <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p align="center" class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4" style="text-align:center"><span lang="EN-US">Are
these thy glorious work, Parent of Good? <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">8.</span> As to the punishments inflicted on
them, says Sir Hans Sloane, "they frequently geld them, or chop off half a
foot: After they are whipped till they are raw all over, some put pepper and
salt upon them; some drop melted wax upon their skin; others cut off their
ears, and constrain them to broil and eat them. For rebellion," (that is,
asserting their native liberty, which they have as much right to as to the air
they breathe,) "they fasten them down to the ground with crooked sticks on
every limb, and then applying fire, by degrees, to the feet and hands, they
burn them gradually upward to the head." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">9.</span> But will not the laws made in the
plantations prevent or redress all cruelty and oppression? We will take but a
few of those laws for a specimen, and then let any man judge:--<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   In order to rivet the
chain of slavery, the law of Virginia ordains: "That no slave shall be set
free upon any pretence whatever, except for some meritorious services, to be
adjudged and allowed by the Governor and Council; and that where any slave shall
be set free by his owner, otherwise than is herein directed, the Churchwardens
of the parish, wherein such Negro shall reside for the space of one month, are
hereby authorized and required to take up and sell the said Negro by public
outcry." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">10.</span> Will not these lawgivers take
effectual care to prevent cruelty and oppression? <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   The law of </span><span lang="EN-US">Jamaica</span><span lang="EN-US"> ordains: "Every slave that shall run away,
and continue absent from his master twelve months, shall be deemed
rebellious." And by another law, fifty pounds are allowed to those who
kill or bring in alive a rebellious slave. So their law treats these poor men
with as little ceremony and consideration, as if they were merely brute beasts!
But the innocent blood which is shed in consequence of such a detestable law,
must call for vengeance on the murderous abettors and actors of such deliberate
wickedness. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">11.</span> But the law of <span class="SpellE">Barbadoes</span>
exceeds even this: "If any Negro under punishment, by his master, or his
order, for running away, or any other crime or misdemeanor, shall suffer in
life or member, no person whatsoever shall be liable to any fine therefore. But
if any <span class="GramE">man, of wantonness, or only of bloody-mindedness, or
cruel intention, <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span> kill</span> a Negro of his
own," (now, observe the severe punishment!) "<span class="GramE">he</span>
shall pay into the public treasury fifteen pounds sterling! <span class="GramE">and</span>
not be liable to any other punishment or forfeiture for the same!" <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   Nearly allied to this
is that law of </span><st1:state><span lang="EN-US">Virginia</span></st1:state><span lang="EN-US">: "After proclamation is issued against
slaves that run away, it is lawful for any person whatsoever to kill and
destroy such <span class="GramE">slaves,</span> by such ways and means as he
shall think fit." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   We have seen already
some of the ways and means which have been thought fit on such occasions; and
many more might be mentioned. One gentleman, when I was abroad, thought fit to
roast his slave alive! But if the most natural act of "running away"
from intolerable <span class="GramE">tyranny,</span> deserves such relentless
severity, what punishment have these lawmakers to expect hereafter, on account
of their own enormous offences? <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">(4) <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">1.</span> This is the plain, <span class="SpellE">unaggravated</span>
matter of fact. Such is the manner wherein our African slaves are procured;
such the manner wherein they are removed from their native land, and wherein
they are treated in our plantations. I would now inquire, whether these things
can be defended, on the principles of even heathen honesty; whether they can be
reconciled (setting the Bible out of the question) with any degree of either
justice or mercy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">2.</span> The grand plea is, "They are
authorized by law." But can law, human law, change the nature of things?
Can it turn darkness into light, or evil into good? <span class="GramE">By no
means.</span> Notwithstanding ten thousand laws, right is right, and wrong is
wrong still. There must still remain an essential difference between justice
and injustice, cruelty and mercy. So that I still ask, <span class="GramE">Who</span>
can reconcile this treatment of the Negroes, first and last, with either mercy
or justice?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   Where is the justice
of inflicting the severest evils on those that have done us no wrong? <span class="GramE">of</span> depriving those that never injured us in word or deed, of
every comfort of life? <span class="GramE">of</span> tearing them from their
native country, and depriving them of liberty itself, to which an Angolan has
the same natural right as an Englishman, and on which he sets as high a value?
Yea, where is the justice of taking away the lives of innocent, inoffensive
men; murdering thousands of them in their own land, by the hands of their own
countrymen; many thousands, year after year, on shipboard, and then casting
them like dung into the sea; and tens of thousands in that cruel slavery to
which they are so unjustly reduced? <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">3.</span> But waving, for the present, all
other considerations, I strike at the root of this complicated <span class="SpellE">villany</span>; I absolutely deny all slave-holding to be
consistent with any degree of natural justice. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   I cannot place this
in a clearer light than that great ornament of his profession, Judge
Blackstone, has already done. <span class="GramE">Part of his words are</span> as
follows: --<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   "The three
origins of the right of slavery assigned by <span class="GramE">Justinian,</span>
are all built upon false foundations: (1.) Slavery is said to arise from
captivity in war. The conqueror having a right to the life of his captives, if
he spares that, has then a right to deal with them as he pleases. But this is
untrue, if taken generally, -- that, by the laws of nations, a man has a right
to kill his enemy. He has only a right to kill him in particular cases, in
cases of absolute necessity for self-<span class="SpellE">defence</span>. And it
is plain, this absolute necessity did not subsist, since he did not kill him,
but made him prisoner. War itself is justifiable only on principles of
self-preservation: Therefore it gives us no right over prisoners, but to hinder
their hurting us by confining them. Much less can it give a right to torture,
or kill, or even to enslave an enemy when the war is <span class="GramE">over.</span>
Since therefore the right of making our prisoners slaves, depends on a supposed
right of slaughter, that foundation failing, the consequence which is drawn
from it must fail likewise. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   "It is said, <span class="GramE">Secondly</span>, slavery may begin by one man's selling himself to
another. And it is true, a man may sell himself to work for another; but he
cannot sell himself to be a slave, as above defined. Every sale implies an
equivalent given to the seller, in lieu of what he transfers to the buyer. But
what equivalent can be given for life or liberty? His property likewise, with
the very price which he seems to receive, devolves <i>ipso facto</i> to his
master, the instant he becomes his slave: In this case, therefore, the buyer
gives nothing, and the seller receives nothing. Of what validity then can a
sale <span class="GramE">be,</span> which destroys the very principle upon which
all sales are founded? <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   "We are told, <span class="GramE">Thirdly</span>, that men may be born slaves, by being the children
of slaves. But this, being built upon the two former rights, must fall together
with them. If neither captivity nor contract can, by the plain law of nature
and reason, reduce the parent to a state of slavery, much less can they reduce
the offspring." It clearly follows, that all slavery is as irreconcilable
to justice as to mercy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">4.</span> That slave-holding is utterly
inconsistent with <span class="GramE">mercy,</span> is almost too plain to need a
proof. Indeed, it is said, "that these Negroes being prisoners of war, our
captains and factors buy them, merely to save them from being put to death. And
is not this mercy?" I answer, (1.) Did Sir John Hawkins, and many others,
seize upon men, women, and children, who were at peace in their own fields or
houses, merely to save them from death? (2.) Was it to save them from <span class="GramE">death, that</span> they knocked out the brains of those they could
not bring away? (3.) Who occasioned and fomented those wars, wherein these poor
creatures were taken prisoners? Who excited them by money, by drink, by every
possible means, to fall upon one another? Was it not themselves? <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   They know in their
own conscience it was, if they have any conscience left. <span class="GramE">But,
(4.)</span> To bring the matter to a short issue, can they say before God, that
they ever took a single voyage, or bought a single Negro, from this motive?
They cannot; they well know, to get money, not to save lives, was the whole and
sole spring of their motions. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">5.</span> But if this manner of procuring and
treating Negroes is not consistent either with mercy or justice, yet there is a
plea for it which every man of business will acknowledge <span class="GramE">to
be</span> quite sufficient. Fifty years ago, one meeting an eminent Statesman
in the lobby of the House of Commons, said, "You have been long talking
about justice and equity. Pray which is this bill; equity or justice?" He
answered very short and plain, "D--n justice; it is necessity." Here
also the slave-holder fixes his foot; here he rests the strength of his cause.
"If it is not quite right, yet it must be so; there is an absolute
necessity for it. It is necessary we should procure slaves; and when we have
procured them, it is necessary to use them with severity, considering their
stupidity, stubbornness, and wickedness."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   I answer, <span class="GramE">You</span> stumble at the threshold; I deny that <span class="SpellE">villany</span> is ever necessary. It is impossible that it should
ever be necessary for any reasonable creature to violate all the laws of
justice, mercy, and truth. No circumstances can make it necessary for a man to
burst in sunder all the ties of humanity. It can never be necessary for a
rational being to sink himself below a brute. A man can be under no necessity
of degrading himself into a wolf. The absurdity of the supposition is so
glaring, that one would wonder any one can help seeing it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">6.</span> This in general. But, to be more
particular, I ask, First, What is necessary? <span class="GramE">and</span>,
Secondly, To what end? It may be answered, "The whole method now used by
the original purchasers of Negroes is necessary to the furnishing our colonies
yearly with a hundred thousand slaves." I grant<span class="GramE">,</span>
this is necessary to that end. But how is that end necessary? How will you
prove it necessary that one hundred, that one, of those slaves should be
procured? "Why, it is necessary to my gaining an hundred thousand
pounds." Perhaps so: But how is this necessary? It is very possible you
might be both a better and a happier man, if you had not a quarter of it. I
deny that your gaining one thousand is necessary either to your present or
eternal happiness. "But, however, you must allow, these slaves are
necessary for the cultivation of our islands; inasmuch as white men are not
able to <span class="SpellE">labour</span> in hot climates." I answer,
First, it were better that all those islands should remain uncultivated for
ever; yea, it were more desirable that they were altogether sunk in the depth
of the sea, than that they should be cultivated at so high a price as the
violation of justice, mercy, and truth. But, Secondly, the supposition on which
you ground your argument is false. For white men, even Englishmen, are well
able to <span class="SpellE">labour</span> in hot climates; provided they are
temperate both in meat and drink, and that they inure themselves to it by
degrees. I speak no more than I know by experience. It appears from the
thermometer, that the summer heat in </span><span lang="EN-US">Georgia</span><span lang="EN-US"> is frequently equal to that in <span class="SpellE">Barbadoes</span>, yea, to that under the line. And yet I and my
family (eight in number) did employ all our spare time there, in felling of
trees and clearing of ground, as hard <span class="SpellE">labour</span> as any
Negro need be employed in. The German <span class="GramE">family, likewise, forty
in number, were</span> employed in all manner of <span class="SpellE">labour</span>.
And this was so far from impairing our <span class="GramE">health, that</span> we
all continued perfectly well, while the idle ones round about us were swept
away as with a pestilence. It is not true, therefore, that white men are not
able to <span class="SpellE">labour</span>, even in hot climates, full as well as
black. But if they were not, it would be better that none should <span class="SpellE">labour</span> there, that the work should be left undone, than
that myriads of innocent men should be murdered, and myriads more dragged into
the basest slavery. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">7.</span> "But the furnishing us with
slaves is necessary for the trade, and wealth, and glory of our nation."
Here are several mistakes. For, <span class="GramE">First</span>, wealth is not
necessary to the glory of any nation; but wisdom, virtue, justice, mercy,
generosity, public spirit, love of our country. These are necessary to the real
glory of a nation; but abundance of wealth is not. Men of understanding allow
that the glory of </span><span lang="EN-US">England</span><span lang="EN-US"> was full as high in Queen Elizabeth's time as
it is now; although our riches and trade were then as much smaller, as our
virtue was greater. But, <span class="GramE">Secondly</span>, it is not clear
that we should have either less money or trade, (only less of that detestable
trade of man-stealing,) if there was not a Negro in all our islands, or in all
English America. It is demonstrable, white men, inured to it by degrees, can
work as well as them; and they would do it, were Negroes out of the way, and
proper encouragement given them. However, Thirdly, I come back to the same
point: Better no trade, than trade procured by <span class="SpellE">villany</span>.
It is far better to have no wealth, than to gain wealth at the expense of
virtue. Better is honest poverty, than all the riches bought by the tears, and
sweat, and blood, of our fellow-creatures. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">8.</span> "However this <span class="GramE">be</span>, it is necessary, when we have slaves, to use them with
severity." What, to whip them for every petty offence, till they are all
in gore blood? <span class="GramE">to</span> take that opportunity of rubbing
pepper and salt into their raw flesh? <span class="GramE">to</span> drop burning
sealing-wax upon their skin? <span class="GramE">to</span> castrate them? <span class="GramE">to</span> cut off half their foot with an axe? <span class="GramE">to</span>
hang them on gibbets, that they may die by inches, with heat, and hunger, and
thirst? <span class="GramE">to</span> pin them down to the ground, and then burn
them by degrees, from the feet to the head? <span class="GramE">to</span> roast
them alive? When did a Turk or a Heathen find it necessary to use a
fellow-creature thus? <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   I pray, to what end <span class="GramE">is</span> this usage necessary? "Why, to prevent their running
away; and to keep them constantly to their <span class="SpellE">labour</span>, that
they may not idle away their time: So miserably stupid is this race of men,
yea, so stubborn, and so wicked." Allowing them to be as stupid as you
say, to whom <span class="GramE">is that stupidity owing</span>? Without
question, it <span class="GramE">lies</span> altogether at the door of their
inhuman masters; who give them no means, no opportunity, of improving their
understanding; and, indeed, leave them no motive, either from hope or fear, to
attempt any such thing. They were no way remarkable for stupidity while they

improvement, are not inferior to the inhabitants of </span><span lang="EN-US">Europe</span><span lang="EN-US" style="color:black">; to some of them they are greatly superior. Impartially

and the Angolans; and on which side does the advantage lie, in point of
understanding? Certainly the African is in no respect inferior to the European.
Their stupidity, therefore, in our plantations is not natural; otherwise than
it is the natural effect of their condition. Consequently, it is not their
fault, but yours: You must answer for it, before God and man. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">9.</span> "But their stupidity is not
the only reason of our treating them with severity. For it is hard to say,
which is the greatest, this, or their stubbornness and wickedness." It may
be so: But do not these, as well as the other, lie at your door? <span class="GramE">Are</span> not stubbornness, cunning, pilfering, and divers other
vices, the natural, necessary fruits of slavery? Is not this an observation
which has been made in every age and nation? And what means have you used to
remove this stubbornness? Have you tried what mildness and gentleness would do?
I knew one that did; that had prudence and patience to make the experiment; Mr.
Hugh Bryan, who then lived on the borders of </span><st1:state><span lang="EN-US">South Carolina</span></st1:state><span lang="EN-US">.
And what was the effect? Why, that all his Negroes (and he had no small number
of them) loved and reverenced him as a father, and cheerfully obeyed him out of
love. Yea, they were more afraid of a frown from him, than of many blows from
an overseer. And what pains have you taken, what method have you used, to
reclaim them from their wickedness? Have you carefully taught them, that there
is a God, a wise, powerful, merciful Being, the Creator and Governor of heaven
and earth? <span class="GramE">that</span> he has appointed a day wherein he will
judge the world, will take an account of all our thoughts, words, and actions? <span class="GramE">that</span> in that day he will reward every child of man according
to his works? <span class="GramE">that</span> then the righteous shall inherit
the kingdom prepared for them from the foundation of the world; and the wicked
shall be cast into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels? If
you have not done this, if you have taken no pains or thought about the matter,
can you wonder at their wickedness? What wonder, if they should cut your
throat? And if they did, whom could you thank for it but yourself? You first
acted the villain in making them slaves, whether you stole them or bought them.
You kept them stupid and wicked, by cutting them off from all opportunities of
improving either in knowledge or virtue: And now you assign their want of
wisdom and goodness as the reason for using them worse than brute beasts! </span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">(5)<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold"> 1.</span> It remains only to make a little application of the preceding
observations. But to whom should that application be made? That may bear a
question. Should we address ourselves to the public at large? What effect can
this have? It may inflame the world against the guilty, but is not likely to
remove that guilt. Should we appeal to the English nation in general? This also
is striking wide; and is never likely to procure any redress for the sore evil
we complain of. As little would it in all probability avail, to apply to the
Parliament. So many things, which seem of greater importance, lie before them,
that they are not likely to attend to this. I therefore add a few words to
those who are more immediately concerned, whether captains, merchants, or
planters. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">2.</span> And, First, to the captains
employed in this trade. Most of you know the country of </span><span lang="EN-US">Guinea</span><span lang="EN-US">; several parts of it, at least, between the
river </span><span lang="EN-US">Senegal</span><span lang="EN-US"> and the </span><span lang="EN-US">kingdom</span><span lang="EN-US"> of </span><span lang="EN-US">Angola</span><span lang="EN-US">. Perhaps, now, by your means part of it is
become a dreary, uncultivated wilderness, the inhabitants being all murdered or
carried away, so that there are none left to till the ground. But you well know
how populous, how fruitful, how pleasant it was a few years ago. You know, the
people were not stupid, not wanting, in sense, considering the few means of improvement
they enjoyed. Neither did you find them savage, fierce, cruel, treacherous, or
unkind to strangers. On the contrary, they were, in most parts, a sensible and
ingenious people. They were kind and friendly, courteous and obliging, and
remarkably fair and just in their dealings. Such are the men whom you hire
their own countrymen to tear away from this lovely country; part by stealth,
part by force, part made captives in those wars which you raise or foment on
purpose. You have seen them torn away, -- children from their parents, parents
from their children; husbands from their wives, wives from their beloved
husbands, brethren and sisters from each other. You have dragged them who had
never done you any wrong, perhaps in chains, from their native shore. You have
forced them into your ships like an herd of swine, -- them who had souls
immortal as your own; only some of them leaped into the sea, and resolutely
stayed under water, till they could suffer no more from you. You have stowed
them together as close as ever they could lie, without any regard either to
decency or convenience. And when many of them had been poisoned by foul air, or
had sunk under various hardships, you have seen their remains delivered to the
deep, till the sea should give up his dead. You have carried the survivors into
the vilest slavery, never to end but with life; such slavery as is not found
among the Turks at </span><span lang="EN-US">Algiers</span><span lang="EN-US" style="color:black">, no, nor among the Heathens in </span><span lang="EN-US">America</span><span lang="EN-US">. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">3.</span> May I speak plainly to you? I must.
Love constrains me; love to you, as well as to those you are concerned with. Is
there a God? You know there is. Is he a just God? Then there must be a state of
retribution; a state wherein the just God will reward every man according to
his works. Then what reward will he render to you? O <span class="GramE">think</span>
betimes! <span class="GramE">before</span> you drop into eternity! Think now,
"He shall have judgment without mercy that showed no mercy." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   Are you a man? Then
you should have <span class="GramE">an</span> human heart. But have you indeed?
What is your heart made of? Is there no such principle as compassion there? Do
you never feel another's pain? Have you no sympathy, no sense of human woe, no
pity for the miserable? When you saw the flowing eyes, the heaving breasts, or
the bleeding sides and tortured limbs of your fellow-creatures, <span class="GramE">was</span> you a stone, or a brute? Did you look upon them with the
eyes of a tiger? When you squeezed the agonizing creatures down in the ship, or
when you threw their poor mangled remains into the sea, had you no relenting?
Did not one tear drop from your eye, one sigh escape from your breast? Do you
feel no relenting now? If you do not, you must go on, till the measure of your
iniquities is full. Then will the great God deal with you as you have dealt
with them, and require all their blood at your hands. And at "that day it
shall be more tolerable for </span><span lang="EN-US">Sodom</span><span lang="EN-US" style="color:black"> and </span><span lang="EN-US">Gomorrah</span><span lang="EN-US" style="color:black"> than for you!" But if your heart does relent, though
in a small degree, know it is a call from the God of love. And "to-day, if
you will hear his voice, <span class="GramE">harden</span> not your heart."
To-day resolve, God being your helper, to escape for your life. Regard not
money! All that a man hath will he give for his life! Whatever you lose, lose
not your soul: Nothing can countervail that loss. Immediately quit the horrid
trade: At all events, <span class="GramE">be</span> an honest man. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">4.</span> This equally concerns every
merchant who is engaged in the slave-trade. It is you that induce the African
villain to sell his countrymen; and in order thereto, to steal, rob, murder
men, women, and children without number, by enabling the English villain to pay
him for so doing, whom you overpay for his execrable <span class="SpellE">labour</span>.
It is your money that is the spring of <span class="GramE">all, that</span>
empowers him to go on: So that whatever he or the African does in this matter
is all your act and deed. And is your conscience quite reconciled to this? Does
it never reproach you at all? Has gold entirely blinded your eyes, and <span class="SpellE">stupified</span> your heart? Can you see, can you feel, no harm
therein? Is it doing as you would be done to? Make the case your own.
"Master," said a slave at Liverpool to the merchant that owned him,
"what, if some of my countrymen were to come here, and take away my
mistress, and Master Tommy, and Master Billy, and carry them into our country,
and make them slaves, how would you like it?" His answer was worthy of a
man: "I will never buy a slave more while I live." O let his
resolution be yours! Have no more any part in this detestable business.
Instantly leave it to those unfeeling wretches who <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p align="center" class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4" style="text-align:center"><span lang="EN-US">Laugh
at human nature and compassion! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">5.</span> And this equally concerns every
gentleman that has an estate in our American plantations; yea, all
slave-holders, of whatever rank and degree; seeing men-buyers are exactly on a
level with men-stealers. Indeed you say, "I pay honestly for my goods; and
I am not concerned to know how they are come by." Nay, but you are; you
are deeply concerned to know they are honestly come by. Otherwise you are a
partaker with a thief, and are not a jot <span class="SpellE">honester</span>
than him. But you know they are not honestly come by; you know they are
procured by means nothing near <span class="GramE">so</span> innocent as picking
of pockets, house-breaking, or robbery upon the highway. You know they are
procured by a deliberate series of more complicated <span class="SpellE">villany</span>
(of fraud, robbery, and murder) than was ever <span class="SpellE">practised</span>
either by <span class="SpellE">Mahometans</span> or Pagans; in particular, by
murders, of all kinds; by the blood of the innocent poured upon the ground like
water. Now, it is your money that pays the merchant, and through him the
captain and the African butchers. You therefore are guilty, yea, principally
guilty, of all these frauds, robberies, and murders. You are the spring that
puts all the rest in motion; they would not stir a step without you; therefore,
the blood of all these wretches who die before their time, whether in their
country or elsewhere, lies upon your head. "The blood of thy brother"
(for, whether thou wilt believe it or no, such he is in the sight of Him that
made him) "<span class="SpellE">crieth</span> against thee from the earth,"
from the ship, and from the waters. O, whatever it costs, put a stop to its cry
before it be too late: Instantly, at any price, <span class="GramE">were</span>
it the half of your goods, deliver thyself from blood-guiltiness! Thy hands,
thy bed, thy furniture, thy house, thy lands, are at present stained with
blood. Surely it is enough; accumulate no more guilt; spill no more the blood
of the innocent! Do not hire another to shed blood; do not pay him for doing
it! Whether you are a Christian or no, show yourself a man! Be not more savage
than a lion or a bear! <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">6.</span> Perhaps you will say, "I do
not buy any Negroes; I only use those left me by my father." So far is
well; but is it enough to satisfy your own conscience? Had your father, have
you, has any man living, a right to use another as a slave? It cannot be, even
setting Revelation aside. It cannot <span class="GramE">be,</span> that either
war, or contract, can give any man such a property in another as he has in his
sheep and oxen. Much less is it possible, that any child of man should ever be
born a slave. </span><span lang="EN-US">Liberty</span><span lang="EN-US"> is the right of every human creature, as soon
as he breathes the vital air; and no human law can deprive him of that right
which he derives from the law of nature. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   If, therefore, you
have any regard to justice, (to say nothing of mercy, nor the revealed law of

nature. Let none serve you but by his own act and deed, by his own voluntary
choice. Away with all whips, all chains, all compulsion! Be gentle toward all
men; and see that you invariably do unto every one as you would he should do
unto you. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

writer well observes, "The variety of forms in which slavery appears, makes
it almost impossible to convey a just notion of it, by way of definition. There
are, however, certain properties which have accompanied slavery in most places,
whereby it is easily distinguished from that mild, domestic service which
obtains in our country."<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">2.</span> Slavery imports an obligation of
perpetual service, an obligation which only the consent of the master can dissolve.
Neither in some countries can the master himself dissolve it, without the
consent of Judges appointed by the law. It generally gives the master an
arbitrary power of any correction, not affecting life or limb. Sometimes even
these are exposed to his will, or protected only by a fine, or some slight
punishment, too inconsiderable to restrain a master of a harsh temper. It
creates <span class="GramE">an incapacity</span> of acquiring anything, except
for the master's benefit. It allows the master to alienate the same, in the same
manner as his cows and horses. Lastly, it descends in its full extent from
parent to child, even to the last generation. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">3.</span> The beginning of this may be dated
from the remotest period of which we have an account in history. It commenced
in the barbarous state of society, and in process of time spread into all
nations. It prevailed particularly among the Jews, the Greeks, the Romans, and
the ancient Germans; and was transmitted by them to the various kingdoms and
states which arose out of the </span><span lang="EN-US">Roman Empire</span><span lang="EN-US" style="color:black">. But after Christianity prevailed, it gradually fell into
decline in almost all parts of </span><span lang="EN-US">Europe</span><span lang="EN-US" style="color:black">. This great change began in </span><span lang="EN-US">Spain</span><span lang="EN-US">, about the end of the eighth century; and was
become general in most other kingdoms of </span><span lang="EN-US">Europe</span><span lang="EN-US" style="color:black">, before the middle of the fourteenth. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">4.</span> From this time slavery was nearly
extinct till the commencement of the sixteenth century, when the discovery of </span><span lang="EN-US">America</span><span lang="EN-US">, and of the western and eastern coasts of </span><span lang="EN-US">Africa</span><span lang="EN-US" style="color:black">, gave occasion to the revival of it. It took its rise from
the Portuguese, who, to supply the Spaniards with men to cultivate their new
possessions in </span><span lang="EN-US">America</span><span lang="EN-US">, procured Negroes from </span><span lang="EN-US">Africa</span><span lang="EN-US" style="color:black">, whom they sold for slaves to the American Spaniards. This
began in the year 1508, when they imported the first Negroes into </span><span lang="EN-US">Hispaniola</span><span lang="EN-US" style="color:black">. In 1540, Charles the Fifth, then King of Spain,
determined to put an end to Negro slavery<span class="GramE">; giving</span>
positive orders that all the Negro slaves in the Spanish dominions should be
set free. And this was accordingly done by <span class="SpellE">Lagasca</span>,
whom he sent and empowered to free them all, on condition of continuing to <span class="SpellE">labour</span> for their masters. <span class="GramE">But soon after <span class="SpellE">Lagasca</span> returned to </span></span><span class="GramE"><span lang="EN-US">Spain</span></span><span class="GramE"><span lang="EN-US">, slavery returned and
flourished as before.</span></span><span lang="EN-US">
Afterwards, other nations, as they acquired possessions in </span><span lang="EN-US">America</span><span lang="EN-US">, followed the examples of the Spaniards; and
slavery has taken deep root in most of our American colonies. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="color:black"><o:p> </o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   (2)<span> Such is the
nature of slavery; such the beginning of Negro slavery in </span></span><span lang="EN-US">America</span><span lang="EN-US">. But some may desire to know what kind of

apprehended so; but it is an entire mistake, if we may give credit to those who

about twelve hundred miles, and contains the kingdoms of </span></span><span lang="EN-US">Congo</span><span lang="EN-US"> and </span><span lang="EN-US">Angola</span><span lang="EN-US">. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">3.</span> Concerning the first, the </span><span lang="EN-US">Senegal</span><span lang="EN-US"> coast, Monsieur <span class="SpellE">Brue</span>,
who lived there sixteen years, after describing its fruitfulness near the sea,
says, "The farther you go from the sea, the more fruitful and
well-improved is the country, abounding in pulse, Indian corn, and various
fruits. Here are vast meadows, which feed large herds of great and small
cattle; and the villages, which lie thick, show the country is well
peopled." And again: "I was surprised to see the land so well
cultivated: Scarce a spot lay unimproved; the low lands, divided by small
canals, were all sowed with rice; the higher grounds were planted with Indian
corn, and peas of different sorts. Their beef is excellent; poultry plenty, and
very cheap, as are all the necessaries of life." <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">4.</span> As to the Grain and </span><span lang="EN-US">Ivory Coast</span><span lang="EN-US">, we learn from eye-witnesses, that the soil is
in general fertile, producing abundance of rice and roots. Indigo and cotton
thrive without cultivation; fish is in great plenty; the flocks and herds are
numerous, and the trees <span class="SpellE">loaden</span> with fruit. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">5.</span> The Gold Coast and </span><span lang="EN-US">Slave Coast</span><span lang="EN-US" style="color:black">, all who have seen it agree, is exceeding fruitful and
pleasant, producing vast quantities of rice and other grain, plenty of fruit
and roots, palm wine and oil, and fish in great abundance, with much tame and
wild cattle. The very same account is given us of the soil and produce of the
kingdoms of </span><span lang="EN-US">Benin</span><span lang="EN-US">, </span><span lang="EN-US">Congo</span><span lang="EN-US">, and </span><span lang="EN-US">Angola</span><span lang="EN-US">.

horrid, dreary, barren country, -- is one of the most fruitful, as well as the
most pleasant, countries in the known world. It is said indeed to be unhealthy;
and so it is to strangers, but perfectly healthy to the native inhabitants. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">6.</span> Such is the country from which the
Negroes are brought. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   We come next to
inquire what sort of men they are, of what temper and <span class="SpellE">behaviour</span>,
not in our plantations; but in their native country. And here likewise the
surest way is to take our account from eye and ear witnesses. Now, those who
have lived in the </span><span lang="EN-US">Senegal</span><span lang="EN-US"> country observe, it is inhabited by three
nations, the <span class="SpellE">Jalofs</span>, <span class="SpellE">Fulis</span>,
and Mandingos. The King of the <span class="SpellE">Jalofs</span> has under him
several Ministers, who assist in the exercise of justice. The Chief Justice
goes in circuit through all his dominions, to hear complaints and determine
controversies; and the Viceroy goes with him, to inspect the <span class="SpellE">behaviour</span> of the <span class="SpellE">Alkadi</span>, or
Governor, of each village. The <span class="SpellE">Fulis</span> are governed by
their chief men, who rule with much moderation. Few of them will drink anything
stronger than water, being strict <span class="SpellE">Mahometans</span>. The
Government is easy, because the people are of a quiet and good disposition, and
so well instructed in what is right, that a man who wrongs another is the
abomination of all. They desire no more land than they use, which they
cultivate with great care and industry: If any of them are known to be made
slaves by the white men, they all join to redeem them. They not only support
all that are old, or blind, or lame among themselves, but have frequently
supplied the necessities of the Mandingos, when they were distressed by famine.
<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">7.</span> "The Mandingos," says
Monsieur <span class="SpellE">Brue</span>, "are rigid <span class="SpellE">Mahometans</span>,
drinking neither wine nor brandy. They are industrious and laborious, keeping
their ground well cultivated, and breeding a good stock of cattle. Every town
has a Governor, and he appoints the <span class="SpellE">labour</span> of the
people. The men work the ground designed for corn; the women and girls, the rice-ground.
He afterwards divides the corn and rice among them; and decides all quarrels,
if any arise. All the <span class="SpellE">Mahometan</span> Negroes constantly go
to public prayers thrice a day; there being a Priest in every village, who
regularly calls them together; and it is surprising to see the modesty,
attention, and reverence which they observe during their worship. These three
nations <span class="SpellE">practise</span> several trades; they have smiths,
saddlers, potters, and weavers; and they are very ingenious at their several
occupations. Their smiths not only make all the instruments of iron which they
have <span class="GramE">occasion</span> to use, but likewise work many things
neatly in gold and silver. It is chiefly the women and children who weave fine
cotton cloth, which they dye blue and black." <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">8.</span> It was of these parts of Guinea
that Monsieur <span class="SpellE">Allanson</span>, correspondent of the Royal
Academy of Sciences at Paris, from 1749 to 1753, gives the following account,
both as to the country and people: -- "Which way <span class="SpellE">soever</span>
I turned my eyes, I beheld a perfect image of pure nature: An agreeable
solitude, bounded on every side by a charming landscape; the rural situation of
cottages in the midst of trees; the ease and quietness of the Negroes, reclined
under the shade of the spreading foliage, with the simplicity of their dress
and manners: The whole revived in my mind the idea of our first parents, and I
seemed to contemplate the world in its primitive state. They are, generally
speaking, very good-natured, sociable, and obliging. I was not a little pleased
with my very first reception; and it fully convinced me, that there ought to be
a considerable abatement made in the accounts we have of the savage character
of the Africans." He adds: "It is amazing that an illiterate people
should reason so pertinently concerning the heavenly bodies. There is no doubt,
but that, with proper instruments, they would become excellent
astronomers." <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">9.</span> The inhabitants of the Grain and </span><span lang="EN-US">Ivory Coast</span><span lang="EN-US"> are represented by those that deal with them,
as sensible, courteous, and the fairest traders on the coasts of </span><span lang="EN-US">Guinea</span><span lang="EN-US">. They rarely drink to excess; if any do, they
are severely punished by the King's order. They are seldom troubled with war:
If <span class="GramE">a difference happen</span> between two nations, they
commonly end the dispute amicably. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   The inhabitants of the
Gold and </span><span lang="EN-US">Slave Coast</span><span lang="EN-US"> likewise, when they are not artfully incensed
against each other, live in great union and friendship, being generally
well-tempered, civil, tractable, and ready to help any that need it. In
particular, the natives of the </span><span lang="EN-US">kingdom</span><span lang="EN-US"> of </span><span class="SpellE"><span lang="EN-US">Whidah</span></span><span lang="EN-US"> are civil, kind, and obliging to strangers; and
they are the most gentleman-like of all the Negroes, abounding in good manners
toward each other. The inferiors pay the utmost respect to their superiors; so
wives to their husbands, children to their parents. And they are remarkably
industrious; all are constantly employed, -- the men in agriculture, the women
in spinning and weaving cotton. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">10.</span> The Gold and </span><span lang="EN-US">Slave</span><span lang="EN-US"> </span><span lang="EN-US">Coasts</span><span lang="EN-US"> are divided into several districts, some
governed by Kings, others by the principal men, who take care each of their own
town or village, and prevent or appease tumults. They punish murder and
adultery severely; very frequently with death. Theft and robbery are punished
by a fine <span class="SpellE">proportionable</span> to the goods that were
taken. All the natives of this coast, though Heathens, believe there is one
God, the Author of them and all things. They appear likewise to have a confused
apprehension of a future state. And, accordingly, every town and village has a
place of public worship. It is remarkable that they have no beggars among them;
such is the care of the chief men, in every city and village, to provide some
easy <span class="SpellE">labour</span> even for the old and weak. Some are
employed in blowing the smiths' bellows; others in pressing palm-oil; others in
grinding of <span class="SpellE">colours</span>. If they are too weak even for
this, they sell provisions in the market. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">11.</span> The natives of the </span><span lang="EN-US">kingdom</span><span lang="EN-US"> of </span><span lang="EN-US">Benin</span><span lang="EN-US" style="color:black"> are a reasonable and good-natured people. They are sincere
and inoffensive, and do no injustice either to one another or to strangers.
They are eminently civil and courteous: If you make them a present, they <span class="SpellE">endeavour</span> to repay it double; and if they are trusted till
the ship returns the next year, they are sure honestly to pay the whole debt.
Theft is punished among them, although not with the same severity as murder. If
a man and woman of any quality are taken in adultery, they are certain to be
put to death, and their bodies thrown on a dunghill, and left a prey to wild
beasts. They are punctually just and honest in their dealings; and are also
very charitable, the King and the great Lords taking care to employ all that
are capable of any work. And those that are utterly helpless they keep for
God's sake; so that here also are no beggars. The inhabitants of </span><span lang="EN-US">Congo</span><span lang="EN-US"> and </span><span lang="EN-US">Angola</span><span lang="EN-US"> are generally a quiet people. They discover a
good understanding, and behave in a friendly manner to strangers, being of a
mild temper and an affable carriage. Upon the whole, therefore, the Negroes who
inhabit the coast of Africa, from the river Senegal to the southern bounds of
Angola, are so far from being the stupid, senseless, brutish, lazy barbarians,
the fierce, cruel, perfidious savages they have been described, that, on the
contrary, they are represented, by them who have no motive to flatter them, as remarkably
sensible, considering the few advantages they have for improving their
understanding; as industrious to the highest degree, perhaps more so than any
other natives of so warm a climate; as fair, just, and honest in all their
dealings, unless where white men have taught them to be otherwise; and as far
more mild, friendly, and kind to strangers, than any of our forefathers were. <i>Our
forefathers!</i> Where shall we find at this day, among the fair-faced natives
of </span><span lang="EN-US">Europe</span><span lang="EN-US">, a nation generally <span class="SpellE">practising</span>
the justice, mercy, and truth, which are found among these poor Africans?
Suppose the preceding accounts are true, (which I see no reason or pretence to
doubt of,) and we may leave </span><span lang="EN-US">England</span><span lang="EN-US"> and </span><span lang="EN-US">France</span><span lang="EN-US">, to seek genuine honesty in </span><span lang="EN-US">Benin</span><span lang="EN-US">, </span><span lang="EN-US">Congo</span><span lang="EN-US">, or </span><span lang="EN-US">Angola</span><span lang="EN-US">. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">(3) We have now seen what kind of
country it is from which the Negroes are brought; and what sort of men (even
white men being the judges) they were in their own country. Inquire we,
Thirdly, <span class="GramE">In</span> what manner are they generally procured,
carried to, and treated in, </span><span lang="EN-US">America</span><span lang="EN-US">. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">1.</span> First. In what manner are they
procured? <span class="GramE">Part of them by fraud.</span> Captains of ships,
from time to time, have invited Negroes to come on board, and then carried them
away. But far more have been procured by force. <span class="GramE">The
Christians, landing upon their coasts, seized as many as they found, men,
women, and children, and transported them to </span></span><span class="GramE"><span lang="EN-US">America</span></span><span class="GramE"><span lang="EN-US">.</span></span><span lang="EN-US"> It was about 1551 that the English began
trading to </span><span lang="EN-US">Guinea</span><span lang="EN-US">; at first, for gold and elephants' teeth; but
soon after, for men. In 1556, Sir John Hawkins sailed with two ships to </span><span lang="EN-US">Cape</span><span lang="EN-US"> </span><span class="SpellE"><span lang="EN-US">Verd</span></span><span lang="EN-US">, where he sent eighty men on shore to catch
Negroes. But the natives flying, they fell farther down, and there set the men
on shore, "to burn their towns and take the inhabitants." But they
met with such resistance, that they had seven men killed, and took but ten
Negroes. So they went still farther down, till, having taken enough, they
proceeded to the </span><span lang="EN-US">West
 Indies</span><span lang="EN-US"> and sold them. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">2.</span> It was some time before the
Europeans found a more compendious way of procuring African slaves, by
prevailing upon them to make war upon each other, and to sell their prisoners.
Till then they seldom had any wars; but were in general quiet and peaceable.
But the white men first taught them drunkenness and avarice, and then hired
them to sell one another. Nay, by this means, even their Kings are induced to
sell their own subjects. So Mr. Moore, factor of the African Company in 1730,
informs us: "When the King of <span class="SpellE">Barsalli</span> wants
goods or brandy, he sends to the English Governor at James's Fort, who
immediately sends a sloop. Against the time it arrives, he plunders some of his
<span class="SpellE">neighbours</span>' towns, selling the people for the goods
he wants. At other times he falls upon one of his own towns, and makes bold to
sell his own subjects." So Monsieur <span class="SpellE">Brue</span> says,
"I wrote to the King," (not the same,) "if he had a sufficient
number of slaves, I would treat with him. He seized three hundred of his own
people, and sent word he was ready to deliver them for the goods." He
adds: "Some of the natives are always ready" (when well paid)
"to surprise and carry off their own countrymen. They come at night
without noise, and if they find any lone cottage, surround it and carry off all
the people." <span class="SpellE">Barbot</span>, another French factor,
says, "Many of the slaves sold by the Negroes are prisoners of war, or
taken in the incursions they make into their enemies' territories. Others are
stolen. Abundance of little Blacks, of both sexes, are stolen away by their <span class="SpellE">neighbours</span>, when found abroad on the road, or in the woods,
or else in the corn-fields, at the time of year when their parents keep them
there all day to scare away the devouring birds." That their own parents
sell them is utterly false: Whites, not Blacks, are without natural affection! <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">3.</span> To set the manner wherein Negroes
are procured in a yet stronger light, it will suffice to give an extract of
"Two Voyages to </span><span lang="EN-US">Guinea</span><span lang="EN-US">" on this account. The first is taken
verbatim from the original manuscript of the Surgeon's Journal: -- <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   "<span class="SpellE">Sestro</span>, </span><st1:date day="29" month="12" year="1724"><span lang="EN-US">Dec. 29, 1724</span></st1:date><span lang="EN-US">. -- No trade to-day, though many traders came
on board. They informed us, that the people are gone to war within land, and
will bring prisoners enough in two or three days; in hopes of which we stay. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span class="GramE">"The
30th.</span> -- No trade yet; but our traders came on board to-day, and informed
us the people had burnt four towns; so that to-morrow we expect slaves off. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span class="GramE">"The
31st. -- Fair weather; but no trading yet.</span> We see each night towns
burning. But we hear many of the <span class="SpellE">Sestro</span> men are
killed by the inland Negroes; so that we fear this war will be unsuccessful. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   "The 2nd of
January. -- Last night we saw a prodigious fire break out about eleven o'clock,
and this morning see the town of <span class="SpellE">Sestro</span> burned down
to the ground." (It contained some hundred houses.) "So that we find
their enemies are too hard for them at present, and consequently our trade
spoiled here. Therefore about </span><st1:time hour="7" minute="0"><span lang="EN-US">seven o'clock</span></st1:time><span lang="EN-US"> we weighed anchor, to <span class="GramE">proceed</span>
lower down."<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">4.</span> The second extract, taken from the
Journal of a Surgeon, who went from </span><st1:state><span lang="EN-US">New York</span></st1:state><span lang="EN-US"> on the same trade, is as follows: "The
commander of the vessel sent to acquaint the King, that he wanted a cargo of
slaves. The King promised to furnish him; and, in order to it, set out,
designing to surprise some town, and make all the people prisoners. Some time
after, the King sent him word, he had not yet met with the desired success;
having attempted to break up two towns, but having been twice repulsed; but
that he still hoped to procure the number of slaves. In this design he
persisted, till he met his enemies in the field. A battle was fought, which
lasted three days. And the engagement was so bloody, that four thousand five
hundred men were slain upon the spot." Such is the manner wherein the
Negroes are procured! Thus the Christians preach the Gospel to the Heathens! <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">5.</span> Thus they are procured. But in what
numbers and in what manner are they carried to </span><span lang="EN-US">America</span><span lang="EN-US">? Mr. Anderson, in his <i>History of Trade and
Commerce</i>, observes: "England supplies her American colonies with Negro
slaves, amounting in number to about an hundred thousand every year;" that
is, so many are taken on board our ships; but at least ten thousand of them die
in the voyage; about a fourth part more die at the different islands, in what
is called the seasoning. So that at an average, in the passage and seasoning
together, thirty thousand die; that is, properly, are murdered. O Earth, O Sea,
cover not thou their blood! <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">6.</span> When they are brought down to the
shore in order to be sold, our Surgeons thoroughly examine them, and that quite
naked, women and men, without any distinction; those that are approved are set
on one side. In the mean time, a burning-iron, with the arms or name of the
company, lies in the fire, with which they are marked on the breast. Before
they are put into the ships, their masters strip them of all they have on their
backs: So that they come on board stark naked, women as well as men. It is
common for several hundred of them to be put on board one vessel, where they
are stowed together in as little room as it is possible for them to be crowded.
It is easy to suppose what a condition they must soon be in, between heat,
thirst, and stench of various kinds. So that it is no wonder, so many should
die in the passage; but rather, that any survive it. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">7. </span>When the vessels arrive at their
destined port, the Negroes are again exposed naked to the eyes of all that
flock together, and the examination of their purchasers. Then they are
separated to the plantations of their several masters, to see each other no
more. Here you may see mothers hanging over their daughters, bedewing their
naked breasts with tears, and daughters clinging to their parents, till the <span class="SpellE">whipper</span> soon obliges them to part. And what can be more
wretched than the condition they then enter upon? Banished from their country,
from their friends and relations for ever, from every comfort of life, they are
reduced to a state scarce anyway preferable to that of beasts of burden. In
general, a few roots, not of the nicest kind, usually yams or potatoes, are their
food; and two rags, that neither <span class="GramE">screen</span> them from the
heat of the day, nor the cold of the night, their covering. Their sleep is very
short, their <span class="SpellE">labour</span> continual, and frequently above
their strength; so that death sets many of them at liberty before they have
lived out half their days. The time they work in the West Indies, is from
day-break to noon, and from two o'clock till dark; during which time, they are
attended by overseers, who, if they think them dilatory, or think anything not
so well done as it should be, whip them most unmercifully, so that you may see
their bodies long after <span class="SpellE">wealed</span> and scarred usually
from the shoulders to the waist. And before they are suffered to go to their
quarters, they have commonly something to do, as collecting herbage for the
horses, or gathering fuel for the boilers; so that it is often past twelve
before they can get home. Hence, if their food is not prepared, they are
sometimes called to <span class="SpellE">labour</span> again, before they can
satisfy their hunger. And no excuse will avail. If they are not in the field
immediately, they must expect to feel the lash. Did the Creator intend that the
noblest creatures in the visible world should live such a life as this? <o:p></o:p></span></p><p align="center" class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4" style="text-align:center"><span lang="EN-US">Are
these thy glorious work, Parent of Good? <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">8.</span> As to the punishments inflicted on
them, says Sir Hans Sloane, "they frequently geld them, or chop off half a
foot: After they are whipped till they are raw all over, some put pepper and
salt upon them; some drop melted wax upon their skin; others cut off their
ears, and constrain them to broil and eat them. For rebellion," (that is,
asserting their native liberty, which they have as much right to as to the air
they breathe,) "they fasten them down to the ground with crooked sticks on
every limb, and then applying fire, by degrees, to the feet and hands, they
burn them gradually upward to the head." <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">9.</span> But will not the laws made in the
plantations prevent or redress all cruelty and oppression? We will take but a
few of those laws for a specimen, and then let any man judge:--<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   In order to rivet the
chain of slavery, the law of Virginia ordains: "That no slave shall be set
free upon any pretence whatever, except for some meritorious services, to be
adjudged and allowed by the Governor and Council; and that where any slave shall
be set free by his owner, otherwise than is herein directed, the Churchwardens
of the parish, wherein such Negro shall reside for the space of one month, are
hereby authorized and required to take up and sell the said Negro by public
outcry." <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">10.</span> Will not these lawgivers take
effectual care to prevent cruelty and oppression? <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   The law of </span><span lang="EN-US">Jamaica</span><span lang="EN-US"> ordains: "Every slave that shall run away,
and continue absent from his master twelve months, shall be deemed
rebellious." And by another law, fifty pounds are allowed to those who
kill or bring in alive a rebellious slave. So their law treats these poor men
with as little ceremony and consideration, as if they were merely brute beasts!
But the innocent blood which is shed in consequence of such a detestable law,
must call for vengeance on the murderous abettors and actors of such deliberate
wickedness. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">11.</span> But the law of <span class="SpellE">Barbadoes</span>
exceeds even this: "If any Negro under punishment, by his master, or his
order, for running away, or any other crime or misdemeanor, shall suffer in
life or member, no person whatsoever shall be liable to any fine therefore. But
if any <span class="GramE">man, of wantonness, or only of bloody-mindedness, or
cruel intention, <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span> kill</span> a Negro of his
own," (now, observe the severe punishment!) "<span class="GramE">he</span>
shall pay into the public treasury fifteen pounds sterling! <span class="GramE">and</span>
not be liable to any other punishment or forfeiture for the same!" <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   Nearly allied to this
is that law of </span><st1:state><span lang="EN-US">Virginia</span></st1:state><span lang="EN-US">: "After proclamation is issued against
slaves that run away, it is lawful for any person whatsoever to kill and
destroy such <span class="GramE">slaves,</span> by such ways and means as he
shall think fit." <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   We have seen already
some of the ways and means which have been thought fit on such occasions; and
many more might be mentioned. One gentleman, when I was abroad, thought fit to
roast his slave alive! But if the most natural act of "running away"
from intolerable <span class="GramE">tyranny,</span> deserves such relentless
severity, what punishment have these lawmakers to expect hereafter, on account
of their own enormous offences? <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">(4) <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">1.</span> This is the plain, <span class="SpellE">unaggravated</span>
matter of fact. Such is the manner wherein our African slaves are procured;
such the manner wherein they are removed from their native land, and wherein
they are treated in our plantations. I would now inquire, whether these things
can be defended, on the principles of even heathen honesty; whether they can be
reconciled (setting the Bible out of the question) with any degree of either
justice or mercy. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">2.</span> The grand plea is, "They are
authorized by law." But can law, human law, change the nature of things?
Can it turn darkness into light, or evil into good? <span class="GramE">By no
means.</span> Notwithstanding ten thousand laws, right is right, and wrong is
wrong still. There must still remain an essential difference between justice
and injustice, cruelty and mercy. So that I still ask, <span class="GramE">Who</span>
can reconcile this treatment of the Negroes, first and last, with either mercy
or justice?<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   Where is the justice
of inflicting the severest evils on those that have done us no wrong? <span class="GramE">of</span> depriving those that never injured us in word or deed, of
every comfort of life? <span class="GramE">of</span> tearing them from their
native country, and depriving them of liberty itself, to which an Angolan has
the same natural right as an Englishman, and on which he sets as high a value?
Yea, where is the justice of taking away the lives of innocent, inoffensive
men; murdering thousands of them in their own land, by the hands of their own
countrymen; many thousands, year after year, on shipboard, and then casting
them like dung into the sea; and tens of thousands in that cruel slavery to
which they are so unjustly reduced? <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">3.</span> But waving, for the present, all
other considerations, I strike at the root of this complicated <span class="SpellE">villany</span>; I absolutely deny all slave-holding to be
consistent with any degree of natural justice. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   I cannot place this
in a clearer light than that great ornament of his profession, Judge
Blackstone, has already done. <span class="GramE">Part of his words are</span> as
follows: --<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   "The three
origins of the right of slavery assigned by <span class="GramE">Justinian,</span>
are all built upon false foundations: (1.) Slavery is said to arise from
captivity in war. The conqueror having a right to the life of his captives, if
he spares that, has then a right to deal with them as he pleases. But this is
untrue, if taken generally, -- that, by the laws of nations, a man has a right
to kill his enemy. He has only a right to kill him in particular cases, in
cases of absolute necessity for self-<span class="SpellE">defence</span>. And it
is plain, this absolute necessity did not subsist, since he did not kill him,
but made him prisoner. War itself is justifiable only on principles of
self-preservation: Therefore it gives us no right over prisoners, but to hinder
their hurting us by confining them. Much less can it give a right to torture,
or kill, or even to enslave an enemy when the war is <span class="GramE">over.</span>
Since therefore the right of making our prisoners slaves, depends on a supposed
right of slaughter, that foundation failing, the consequence which is drawn
from it must fail likewise. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   "It is said, <span class="GramE">Secondly</span>, slavery may begin by one man's selling himself to
another. And it is true, a man may sell himself to work for another; but he
cannot sell himself to be a slave, as above defined. Every sale implies an
equivalent given to the seller, in lieu of what he transfers to the buyer. But
what equivalent can be given for life or liberty? His property likewise, with
the very price which he seems to receive, devolves <i>ipso facto</i> to his
master, the instant he becomes his slave: In this case, therefore, the buyer
gives nothing, and the seller receives nothing. Of what validity then can a
sale <span class="GramE">be,</span> which destroys the very principle upon which
all sales are founded? <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   "We are told, <span class="GramE">Thirdly</span>, that men may be born slaves, by being the children
of slaves. But this, being built upon the two former rights, must fall together
with them. If neither captivity nor contract can, by the plain law of nature
and reason, reduce the parent to a state of slavery, much less can they reduce
the offspring." It clearly follows, that all slavery is as irreconcilable
to justice as to mercy. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">4.</span> That slave-holding is utterly
inconsistent with <span class="GramE">mercy,</span> is almost too plain to need a
proof. Indeed, it is said, "that these Negroes being prisoners of war, our
captains and factors buy them, merely to save them from being put to death. And
is not this mercy?" I answer, (1.) Did Sir John Hawkins, and many others,
seize upon men, women, and children, who were at peace in their own fields or
houses, merely to save them from death? (2.) Was it to save them from <span class="GramE">death, that</span> they knocked out the brains of those they could
not bring away? (3.) Who occasioned and fomented those wars, wherein these poor
creatures were taken prisoners? Who excited them by money, by drink, by every
possible means, to fall upon one another? Was it not themselves? <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   They know in their
own conscience it was, if they have any conscience left. <span class="GramE">But,
(4.)</span> To bring the matter to a short issue, can they say before God, that
they ever took a single voyage, or bought a single Negro, from this motive?
They cannot; they well know, to get money, not to save lives, was the whole and
sole spring of their motions. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">5.</span> But if this manner of procuring and
treating Negroes is not consistent either with mercy or justice, yet there is a
plea for it which every man of business will acknowledge <span class="GramE">to
be</span> quite sufficient. Fifty years ago, one meeting an eminent Statesman
in the lobby of the House of Commons, said, "You have been long talking
about justice and equity. Pray which is this bill; equity or justice?" He
answered very short and plain, "D--n justice; it is necessity." Here
also the slave-holder fixes his foot; here he rests the strength of his cause.
"If it is not quite right, yet it must be so; there is an absolute
necessity for it. It is necessary we should procure slaves; and when we have
procured them, it is necessary to use them with severity, considering their
stupidity, stubbornness, and wickedness."<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   I answer, <span class="GramE">You</span> stumble at the threshold; I deny that <span class="SpellE">villany</span> is ever necessary. It is impossible that it should
ever be necessary for any reasonable creature to violate all the laws of
justice, mercy, and truth. No circumstances can make it necessary for a man to
burst in sunder all the ties of humanity. It can never be necessary for a
rational being to sink himself below a brute. A man can be under no necessity
of degrading himself into a wolf. The absurdity of the supposition is so
glaring, that one would wonder any one can help seeing it. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">6.</span> This in general. But, to be more
particular, I ask, First, What is necessary? <span class="GramE">and</span>,
Secondly, To what end? It may be answered, "The whole method now used by
the original purchasers of Negroes is necessary to the furnishing our colonies
yearly with a hundred thousand slaves." I grant<span class="GramE">,</span>
this is necessary to that end. But how is that end necessary? How will you
prove it necessary that one hundred, that one, of those slaves should be
procured? "Why, it is necessary to my gaining an hundred thousand
pounds." Perhaps so: But how is this necessary? It is very possible you
might be both a better and a happier man, if you had not a quarter of it. I
deny that your gaining one thousand is necessary either to your present or
eternal happiness. "But, however, you must allow, these slaves are
necessary for the cultivation of our islands; inasmuch as white men are not
able to <span class="SpellE">labour</span> in hot climates." I answer,
First, it were better that all those islands should remain uncultivated for
ever; yea, it were more desirable that they were altogether sunk in the depth
of the sea, than that they should be cultivated at so high a price as the
violation of justice, mercy, and truth. But, Secondly, the supposition on which
you ground your argument is false. For white men, even Englishmen, are well
able to <span class="SpellE">labour</span> in hot climates; provided they are
temperate both in meat and drink, and that they inure themselves to it by
degrees. I speak no more than I know by experience. It appears from the
thermometer, that the summer heat in </span><span lang="EN-US">Georgia</span><span lang="EN-US"> is frequently equal to that in <span class="SpellE">Barbadoes</span>, yea, to that under the line. And yet I and my
family (eight in number) did employ all our spare time there, in felling of
trees and clearing of ground, as hard <span class="SpellE">labour</span> as any
Negro need be employed in. The German <span class="GramE">family, likewise, forty
in number, were</span> employed in all manner of <span class="SpellE">labour</span>.
And this was so far from impairing our <span class="GramE">health, that</span> we
all continued perfectly well, while the idle ones round about us were swept
away as with a pestilence. It is not true, therefore, that white men are not
able to <span class="SpellE">labour</span>, even in hot climates, full as well as
black. But if they were not, it would be better that none should <span class="SpellE">labour</span> there, that the work should be left undone, than
that myriads of innocent men should be murdered, and myriads more dragged into
the basest slavery. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">7.</span> "But the furnishing us with
slaves is necessary for the trade, and wealth, and glory of our nation."
Here are several mistakes. For, <span class="GramE">First</span>, wealth is not
necessary to the glory of any nation; but wisdom, virtue, justice, mercy,
generosity, public spirit, love of our country. These are necessary to the real
glory of a nation; but abundance of wealth is not. Men of understanding allow
that the glory of </span><span lang="EN-US">England</span><span lang="EN-US"> was full as high in Queen Elizabeth's time as
it is now; although our riches and trade were then as much smaller, as our
virtue was greater. But, <span class="GramE">Secondly</span>, it is not clear
that we should have either less money or trade, (only less of that detestable
trade of man-stealing,) if there was not a Negro in all our islands, or in all
English America. It is demonstrable, white men, inured to it by degrees, can
work as well as them; and they would do it, were Negroes out of the way, and
proper encouragement given them. However, Thirdly, I come back to the same
point: Better no trade, than trade procured by <span class="SpellE">villany</span>.
It is far better to have no wealth, than to gain wealth at the expense of
virtue. Better is honest poverty, than all the riches bought by the tears, and
sweat, and blood, of our fellow-creatures. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">8.</span> "However this <span class="GramE">be</span>, it is necessary, when we have slaves, to use them with
severity." What, to whip them for every petty offence, till they are all
in gore blood? <span class="GramE">to</span> take that opportunity of rubbing
pepper and salt into their raw flesh? <span class="GramE">to</span> drop burning
sealing-wax upon their skin? <span class="GramE">to</span> castrate them? <span class="GramE">to</span> cut off half their foot with an axe? <span class="GramE">to</span>
hang them on gibbets, that they may die by inches, with heat, and hunger, and
thirst? <span class="GramE">to</span> pin them down to the ground, and then burn
them by degrees, from the feet to the head? <span class="GramE">to</span> roast
them alive? When did a Turk or a Heathen find it necessary to use a
fellow-creature thus? <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   I pray, to what end <span class="GramE">is</span> this usage necessary? "Why, to prevent their running
away; and to keep them constantly to their <span class="SpellE">labour</span>, that
they may not idle away their time: So miserably stupid is this race of men,
yea, so stubborn, and so wicked." Allowing them to be as stupid as you
say, to whom <span class="GramE">is that stupidity owing</span>? Without
question, it <span class="GramE">lies</span> altogether at the door of their
inhuman masters; who give them no means, no opportunity, of improving their
understanding; and, indeed, leave them no motive, either from hope or fear, to
attempt any such thing. They were no way remarkable for stupidity while they
remained in their own country: The inhabitants of </span><span lang="EN-US">Africa</span><span lang="EN-US" style="color:black">, where they have equal motives and equal means of
improvement, are not inferior to the inhabitants of </span><span lang="EN-US">Europe</span><span lang="EN-US" style="color:black">; to some of them they are greatly superior. Impartially
survey, in their own country, the natives of </span><span lang="EN-US">Benin</span><span lang="EN-US">, and the natives of </span><span lang="EN-US">Lapland</span><span lang="EN-US" style="color:black">; compare (setting prejudice aside) the <span class="SpellE">Samoeids</span>
and the Angolans; and on which side does the advantage lie, in point of
understanding? Certainly the African is in no respect inferior to the European.
Their stupidity, therefore, in our plantations is not natural; otherwise than
it is the natural effect of their condition. Consequently, it is not their
fault, but yours: You must answer for it, before God and man. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">9.</span> "But their stupidity is not
the only reason of our treating them with severity. For it is hard to say,
which is the greatest, this, or their stubbornness and wickedness." It may
be so: But do not these, as well as the other, lie at your door? <span class="GramE">Are</span> not stubbornness, cunning, pilfering, and divers other
vices, the natural, necessary fruits of slavery? Is not this an observation
which has been made in every age and nation? And what means have you used to
remove this stubbornness? Have you tried what mildness and gentleness would do?
I knew one that did; that had prudence and patience to make the experiment; Mr.
Hugh Bryan, who then lived on the borders of </span><st1:state><span lang="EN-US">South Carolina</span></st1:state><span lang="EN-US">.
And what was the effect? Why, that all his Negroes (and he had no small number
of them) loved and reverenced him as a father, and cheerfully obeyed him out of
love. Yea, they were more afraid of a frown from him, than of many blows from
an overseer. And what pains have you taken, what method have you used, to
reclaim them from their wickedness? Have you carefully taught them, that there
is a God, a wise, powerful, merciful Being, the Creator and Governor of heaven
and earth? <span class="GramE">that</span> he has appointed a day wherein he will
judge the world, will take an account of all our thoughts, words, and actions? <span class="GramE">that</span> in that day he will reward every child of man according
to his works? <span class="GramE">that</span> then the righteous shall inherit
the kingdom prepared for them from the foundation of the world; and the wicked
shall be cast into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels? If
you have not done this, if you have taken no pains or thought about the matter,
can you wonder at their wickedness? What wonder, if they should cut your
throat? And if they did, whom could you thank for it but yourself? You first
acted the villain in making them slaves, whether you stole them or bought them.
You kept them stupid and wicked, by cutting them off from all opportunities of
improving either in knowledge or virtue: And now you assign their want of
wisdom and goodness as the reason for using them worse than brute beasts! </span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">(5)<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold"> 1.</span> It remains only to make a little application of the preceding
observations. But to whom should that application be made? That may bear a
question. Should we address ourselves to the public at large? What effect can
this have? It may inflame the world against the guilty, but is not likely to
remove that guilt. Should we appeal to the English nation in general? This also
is striking wide; and is never likely to procure any redress for the sore evil
we complain of. As little would it in all probability avail, to apply to the
Parliament. So many things, which seem of greater importance, lie before them,
that they are not likely to attend to this. I therefore add a few words to
those who are more immediately concerned, whether captains, merchants, or
planters. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">2.</span> And, First, to the captains
employed in this trade. Most of you know the country of </span><span lang="EN-US">Guinea</span><span lang="EN-US">; several parts of it, at least, between the
river </span><span lang="EN-US">Senegal</span><span lang="EN-US"> and the </span><span lang="EN-US">kingdom</span><span lang="EN-US"> of </span><span lang="EN-US">Angola</span><span lang="EN-US">. Perhaps, now, by your means part of it is
become a dreary, uncultivated wilderness, the inhabitants being all murdered or
carried away, so that there are none left to till the ground. But you well know
how populous, how fruitful, how pleasant it was a few years ago. You know, the
people were not stupid, not wanting, in sense, considering the few means of improvement
they enjoyed. Neither did you find them savage, fierce, cruel, treacherous, or
unkind to strangers. On the contrary, they were, in most parts, a sensible and
ingenious people. They were kind and friendly, courteous and obliging, and
remarkably fair and just in their dealings. Such are the men whom you hire
their own countrymen to tear away from this lovely country; part by stealth,
part by force, part made captives in those wars which you raise or foment on
purpose. You have seen them torn away, -- children from their parents, parents
from their children; husbands from their wives, wives from their beloved
husbands, brethren and sisters from each other. You have dragged them who had
never done you any wrong, perhaps in chains, from their native shore. You have
forced them into your ships like an herd of swine, -- them who had souls
immortal as your own; only some of them leaped into the sea, and resolutely
stayed under water, till they could suffer no more from you. You have stowed
them together as close as ever they could lie, without any regard either to
decency or convenience. And when many of them had been poisoned by foul air, or
had sunk under various hardships, you have seen their remains delivered to the
deep, till the sea should give up his dead. You have carried the survivors into
the vilest slavery, never to end but with life; such slavery as is not found
among the Turks at </span><span lang="EN-US">Algiers</span><span lang="EN-US" style="color:black">, no, nor among the Heathens in </span><span lang="EN-US">America</span><span lang="EN-US">. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">3.</span> May I speak plainly to you? I must.
Love constrains me; love to you, as well as to those you are concerned with. Is
there a God? You know there is. Is he a just God? Then there must be a state of
retribution; a state wherein the just God will reward every man according to
his works. Then what reward will he render to you? O <span class="GramE">think</span>
betimes! <span class="GramE">before</span> you drop into eternity! Think now,
"He shall have judgment without mercy that showed no mercy." <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   Are you a man? Then
you should have <span class="GramE">an</span> human heart. But have you indeed?
What is your heart made of? Is there no such principle as compassion there? Do
you never feel another's pain? Have you no sympathy, no sense of human woe, no
pity for the miserable? When you saw the flowing eyes, the heaving breasts, or
the bleeding sides and tortured limbs of your fellow-creatures, <span class="GramE">was</span> you a stone, or a brute? Did you look upon them with the
eyes of a tiger? When you squeezed the agonizing creatures down in the ship, or
when you threw their poor mangled remains into the sea, had you no relenting?
Did not one tear drop from your eye, one sigh escape from your breast? Do you
feel no relenting now? If you do not, you must go on, till the measure of your
iniquities is full. Then will the great God deal with you as you have dealt
with them, and require all their blood at your hands. And at "that day it
shall be more tolerable for </span><span lang="EN-US">Sodom</span><span lang="EN-US" style="color:black"> and </span><span lang="EN-US">Gomorrah</span><span lang="EN-US" style="color:black"> than for you!" But if your heart does relent, though
in a small degree, know it is a call from the God of love. And "to-day, if
you will hear his voice, <span class="GramE">harden</span> not your heart."
To-day resolve, God being your helper, to escape for your life. Regard not
money! All that a man hath will he give for his life! Whatever you lose, lose
not your soul: Nothing can countervail that loss. Immediately quit the horrid
trade: At all events, <span class="GramE">be</span> an honest man. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">4.</span> This equally concerns every
merchant who is engaged in the slave-trade. It is you that induce the African
villain to sell his countrymen; and in order thereto, to steal, rob, murder
men, women, and children without number, by enabling the English villain to pay
him for so doing, whom you overpay for his execrable <span class="SpellE">labour</span>.
It is your money that is the spring of <span class="GramE">all, that</span>
empowers him to go on: So that whatever he or the African does in this matter
is all your act and deed. And is your conscience quite reconciled to this? Does
it never reproach you at all? Has gold entirely blinded your eyes, and <span class="SpellE">stupified</span> your heart? Can you see, can you feel, no harm
therein? Is it doing as you would be done to? Make the case your own.
"Master," said a slave at Liverpool to the merchant that owned him,
"what, if some of my countrymen were to come here, and take away my
mistress, and Master Tommy, and Master Billy, and carry them into our country,
and make them slaves, how would you like it?" His answer was worthy of a
man: "I will never buy a slave more while I live." O let his
resolution be yours! Have no more any part in this detestable business.
Instantly leave it to those unfeeling wretches who <o:p></o:p></span></p><p align="center" class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4" style="text-align:center"><span lang="EN-US">Laugh
at human nature and compassion! <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   Be you a man, not a
wolf, a devourer of the human species! Be merciful, that you may obtain mercy! <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">5.</span> And this equally concerns every
gentleman that has an estate in our American plantations; yea, all
slave-holders, of whatever rank and degree; seeing men-buyers are exactly on a
level with men-stealers. Indeed you say, "I pay honestly for my goods; and
I am not concerned to know how they are come by." Nay, but you are; you
are deeply concerned to know they are honestly come by. Otherwise you are a
partaker with a thief, and are not a jot <span class="SpellE">honester</span>
than him. But you know they are not honestly come by; you know they are
procured by means nothing near <span class="GramE">so</span> innocent as picking
of pockets, house-breaking, or robbery upon the highway. You know they are
procured by a deliberate series of more complicated <span class="SpellE">villany</span>
(of fraud, robbery, and murder) than was ever <span class="SpellE">practised</span>
either by <span class="SpellE">Mahometans</span> or Pagans; in particular, by
murders, of all kinds; by the blood of the innocent poured upon the ground like
water. Now, it is your money that pays the merchant, and through him the
captain and the African butchers. You therefore are guilty, yea, principally
guilty, of all these frauds, robberies, and murders. You are the spring that
puts all the rest in motion; they would not stir a step without you; therefore,
the blood of all these wretches who die before their time, whether in their
country or elsewhere, lies upon your head. "The blood of thy brother"
(for, whether thou wilt believe it or no, such he is in the sight of Him that
made him) "<span class="SpellE">crieth</span> against thee from the earth,"
from the ship, and from the waters. O, whatever it costs, put a stop to its cry
before it be too late: Instantly, at any price, <span class="GramE">were</span>
it the half of your goods, deliver thyself from blood-guiltiness! Thy hands,
thy bed, thy furniture, thy house, thy lands, are at present stained with
blood. Surely it is enough; accumulate no more guilt; spill no more the blood
of the innocent! Do not hire another to shed blood; do not pay him for doing
it! Whether you are a Christian or no, show yourself a man! Be not more savage
than a lion or a bear! <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">6.</span> Perhaps you will say, "I do
not buy any Negroes; I only use those left me by my father." So far is
well; but is it enough to satisfy your own conscience? Had your father, have
you, has any man living, a right to use another as a slave? It cannot be, even
setting Revelation aside. It cannot <span class="GramE">be,</span> that either
war, or contract, can give any man such a property in another as he has in his
sheep and oxen. Much less is it possible, that any child of man should ever be
born a slave. </span><span lang="EN-US">Liberty</span><span lang="EN-US"> is the right of every human creature, as soon
as he breathes the vital air; and no human law can deprive him of that right
which he derives from the law of nature. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   If, therefore, you
have any regard to justice, (to say nothing of mercy, nor the revealed law of
God,) render unto all their due. Give liberty to <span class="GramE">whom</span>
liberty is due, that is, to every child of man, to every partaker of human
nature. Let none serve you but by his own act and deed, by his own voluntary
choice. Away with all whips, all chains, all compulsion! Be gentle toward all
men; and see that you invariably do unto every one as you would he should do
unto you. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span lang="EN-US">   <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">7.</span> O thou God of love, thou who art

purchase of thy Son's blood? Stir them up to cry unto thee in the land of their
captivity; and let their complaint come up before thee; let it enter into thy
