Of their humility they had given a continual proof by performing those servile offices for the other passengers, which none of the English would undertake; for which they desired and would receive no pay, saying, it was good for their proud hearts, and their loving Saviour had done more for them. And every day had given them an occasion of showing a meekness which no injury could move. If they were pushed, struck, or thrown down, they rose again and went away; but no complaint was found in their mouth. There was now an opportunity of trying whether they were delivered from the spirit of fear, as well as from that of pride, anger and revenge.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">In the midst of the psalm wherewith their service began, the sea broke over, split the mainsail in pieces, covered the ship, and poured in between the decks, as if the great deep had already swallowed us up.

At the house of Mr. Weinantz, a Dutch merchant, I met Peter Bohler</span>, Schulius</span> Richter, and Wensel</span> Neiser</span>, just then landed from</span><st1:country-region><st1:place>Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Finding they had no acquaintance in <st1:country-region><st1:place>England</st1:place></st1:country-region>, I offered to procure them a lodging and did so near Mr. Huttons, where I then was. And from this time I did not willingly lose any opportunity of conversing with them while I stayed in <st1:city><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:city>.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><u>Peter Bohler preaches justification by faith alone to the Wesleys</span>.</span></u></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Saturday March 4, 1738</b>.I found my brother at <st1:city><st1:place>Oxford</st1:place></st1:city>, recovering from his pleurisy; and with him Peter Bohler; by whom, in the hand of the great God, I was, on Sunday, the fifth, clearly convinced of unbelief, of the want of that faith whereby alone we are saved.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Immediately it struck into my mind, Leave off preaching. How can you preach to others, who have not faith yourself? I asked Bohler whether he thought I should leave it off or not. He answered, By no means. I asked, But what can I preach? He said, Preach faith till you have it; and then, because you have it, you will preach faith.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Accordingly, <b>Monday, March 6</b>, I began preaching this new doctrine, though my soul started back from the work. The first person to whom I offered salvation by faith alone was a prisoner under sentence of death. His name was Clifford. Peter Bohler had many times desired me to speak to him before. But I could not prevail on myself so to do; being still, as I had been many years, a zealous asserter of the impossibility of a deathbed repentance.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Monday May 1, 1738</b>.The return of my brothers illness obliged me again to hasten to <st1:city><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:city>. In the evening I found him at James Huttons, better as to his health than I expected; but strongly averse to what he called the new faith.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">This evening our little society began, which afterward met in <st1:street><st1:address>Fetter Lane</st1:address></st1:street>.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Wednesday May 3, 1738</b>.My brother had a long and particular conversation with Peter Bohler. And it now pleased God to open his eyes so that he also saw clearly what was the nature of that one true living faith, whereby alone, through grace, we are saved.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Thursday May 4, 1738</b>.Peter Bohler left</span><st1:city><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:city> in order to embark for <st1:city><st1:place>Carolina</st1:place></st1:city>.

Just as I went out, I opened it again on those words, Thou art not far from the</span><st1:place><st1:placetype>kingdom</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>God</st1:placename></st1:place> [<a name="_Mark_12_34_0_0"></a><span><span>Mark 12:34</span>]. In the afternoon I was asked to go to</span><st1:city><st1:place>St. Paul</st1:place></st1:city>s. The anthem was, Out of the deep have I called unto Thee, O Lord: Lord, hear my voice. Oh, let Thine ears consider well the voice of my complaint. If Thou, Lord, wilt be extreme to mark what is done amiss, O Lord, who may abide it? For there is mercy with Thee; therefore shalt</span> Thou be feared. O Israel, trust in the Lord: for with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him is plenteous redemption. And He shall redeem</span><st1:country-region><st1:place>Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region> from all his sins.</p> <p class="body text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">In the evening I went very unwillingly to a society in <st1:street><st1:address>Aldersgate</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>, where one was reading Luthers preface to the Epistle to the Romans. About a <st1:time hour="8" minute="45">quarter before nine</st1:time>, while he was describing the change which God works in the heart through faith in Christ, I felt my heart strangely warmed. I felt I did trust in Christ, Christ alone, for salvation; and an assurance was given me that He had taken away my sins, even mine, and saved me from the law of sin and death.</p> <p class="body text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">I began to pray with all my might for those who had in a more especial manner despitefully used me and persecuted me. I then testified openly to all there what I now first felt in my heart. But it was not long before the enemy suggested, This cannot be faith; for where is thy joy? Then was I taught that peace and victory over sin are essential to faith in the Captain of our salvation; but that, as to the transports of joy that usually attend the beginning of it, especially in those who have mourned deeply, God sometimes giveth, sometimes withholdeth</span>, them according to the counsels of His own will.</span></p> <p class="body text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">After my return home, I was much buffeted with temptations, but I cried out, and they fled away. They returned again and again. I as often lifted up my eyes, and He sent me help from his holy place. And herein I found the difference between this and my former state chiefly consisted. I was striving, yea, fighting with all my might under the law, as well as under grace. But then I was sometimes, if not often, conquered; now, I was always conqueror.</p> <p class="body text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Thursday 25 May, 1738</b>.The moment I awakened, Jesus, Master, was in my heart and in my mouth; and I found all my strength lay in keeping my eye fixed upon Him and my soul waiting on Him continually. Being again at <st1:city><st1:place>St. Paul</st1:place></st1:city>s in the afternoon, I could taste the good word of God in the anthem which began, My song shall be always of the loving-kindness of the Lord: with my mouth will I ever be showing forth thy truth from one generation to another. Yet the enemy injected a fear, If thou dost believe, why is there not a more sensible change? I answered (yet not I), That I know not. But, this I know, I have now peace with God. And I sin not today, and Jesus my Master has forbidden me to take thought for the morrow.</p> <p class="body text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Wednesday June 7, 1738</b>.I determined, if God should permit, to retire for a short time into <st1:country-region><st1:place>Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>. I had fully proposed, before I left <st1:country-region><st1:place>Georgia</st1:place></st1:country-region>, so to do if it should please God to bring me back to <st1:place>Europe</st1:place>. And I now clearly saw the time was come. My weak mind could not bear to be thus sawn asunder. And I hoped the conversing with those holy men who were themselves living witnesses of the full power of faith, and yet able to bear with those that are weak, would be a means, under God, of so establishing my soul that I might go on from faith to faith, and from strength to strength.</p> <p class="body text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">[The next three months Wesley spent in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region> visiting the Moravians.]</p> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2"></h3>
