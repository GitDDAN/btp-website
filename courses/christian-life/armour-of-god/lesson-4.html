<p><b>Lesson Title: </b>Stand fast in the liberty of Christ.</p>
'Stand fast therefore in the liberty
wherewith Christ has made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of
bondage.' Galatians 5:1
Stand fast in the liberty of Christ. 
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The
devil seeks to bring people into bondage. </p>
<p>It is often the things that are good that the devil
uses to bind us.See Luke 17:26-30.</p>
<p>For instance: </p>
<p>•the desire to keep the law, </p>
<p>•the desire for friendship and acceptance, </p>
<p>•marriage, and </p>
<p>•the
concern for everyday needs.</p>
<p>All these things are good but if we live for these
things we will lose the liberty that is in Christ.</p>
<h3>Introductory Story</h3>
<p>Personal Testimony
- boys on the London Underground. </p>
<p>Just before Christmas 2002 I went by ship from London to my
home in Denmark. I was
able to take as much luggage as I could carry so I used my son's rucksack, but
I was not used to wearing it on my back. I had to go to the harbour by train,
but first I had to travel on the London Underground.When I walked down the platform at the
underground train station I passed three young boys about 13 years old who were
standing on the platform. They obviously saw that there were loose tassels on
the bag on my back and saw an opportunity to have some fun.</p>
<p>I didn't take the rucksack off my back, as it was
heavy and very hard to put back on when I needed to get off the train.I stood by the door of the train then the
three boys came through the train to the carriage where I was standing and sat
on seats nearby staring at me. I knew they were wanting to do something but I
wasn't sure what. I was afraid they would try to steal my bag. I moved away
from them and stood with my back to them. </p>
<p>I was unaware that one of the boys went silently
behind me and tied one of the loose tassels to a bar on the train. A little
while later I went to move and found I was stuck. I tried to reach round to
loose the tassel but my arm could not reach. The only thing I could do was to
take the rucksack off and untie myself. The boys had great amusement mimicking
my actions while I was tied to the bar.</p>
<p>•The devil works in the same way. He may not be able
to stop the Christian from receiving eternal life but he looks for opportunities
to stop us from being able to move in our spiritual life. He seeks for ways to
bind us so that our walk with the Lord is hindered. The snares can be worldly
amusements, bad company, being in the wrong place etc. But we can also become
bound in our zeal for 'purity of faith'.If we put this above our relationship with Christ we can become bound by
legalism, self righteousness, and become critical instead of covering sins by
love. </p>
<p>•If a friend had been with me the boys would not
have been able to tie me to the bar, and even if they had the friend could have
quickly released me. In the same way we need to watch out for one another. The
armour of God is given for the protection of the whole body of Christ.</p>
<h2>Main Points</h2>
<p>1.Stand fast in the new creation, </p>
<p>•The Christian life is a new creation. 'Therefore
if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away
behold, all things are become new.;'(2 Corinthians 5:17)<span>.<b></b>New Testament Christianity is a new
life.It is the life of Christ in the believer,
crucified with Christ; buried with Christ; risen with Christ; seated in
heavenly places with Christ).</span>'If you then
be risen with Christ, seek those things which are
above, where Christ sits on the right hand of God.Set your affection on things above, not on
things on the earth.For you are dead,
and your life is hid with Christ in God.When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall you also appear
with him in glory.' (Colossians 3:1-4)</p>
<p>•Carnality will always gravitate to the Old Testament.Legalism and morality will leave us bound to
keeping the law.Holiness is the life of
the Spirit. If we seek to produce holiness through our own endeavours then we will
become bound by self righteousness and legalism. If we seek to live the Christian
life in our own strength we will be bound by discouragement and condemnation. </p>
<p><b>Illustration:</b>When a plane flies to another continent it is
bound by laws.It must fly at a certain
height within a particular lane.A bird
flies without a control centre directing its path yet the bird has perfect
navigation.A plane needs to be given
diesel or it will have no power to fly.A bird is born with the strength and ability to fly but a Boeing 747
(Jumbo Jet) takes 174 tons of fuel and costs a lot of money to fill.The Old Testament law is like a control
centre.The New Testament Christian is
like the bird that does not need a control centre. </p>
<p>2.Stand fast by walking in the Spirit.</p>
<p>•Our lives must produce the fruit of the Spirit
through our relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ otherwise we will be in
bondage to the works of the flesh, Galations5:19-24. </p>
<p>•Walking in the Spirit means
walking in love and not giving place to the works of the flesh.Galatians 5:25,'If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.' Walking
in the flesh means being led by wrong thoughts and wrong desires, resulting in
wrong actions.The works of the flesh
bring bondage; the fruit of the Spirit brings freedom.</p>
<p>•Walking in the Spirit means serving one another in
love.Galatians 5:13 'by love serve one another'.The liberty of Christ is the liberty to
serve.Idolatry is the love of the world
and this will stop us serving one another in love, 1 John 5:21.The love of the world is in opposition to the
love of Christ.Idolatry produces
bondage.The idolater becomes a slave of
the idol worship.</p>
<p>3.Stand fast by avoiding wrong relationships, 2 Corinthians 6:14-18.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wrong
     relationships will prevent us from using our lives for God.'Be
     not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.' 1 Corinthians
     15:33.Wrong company will lead to wrong
     behaviour, Psalm 1.When
     I was at Bible school we were taught that the path of wrong behaviour can
     begin with shock at seeing the bad behaviour, but then this can lead to
     acceptance as we become more acquainted with the bad behaviour and finally
     we can end up participating in the bad behaviour.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disgusted and shocked - accustomed and accepting - active and participating.</p>
<p>The armour of God must be worn at all times otherwise we can come to
accept the world's standards and participate in lustful actions that will
destroy our testimony.</p>
<p>Love not the
world.'Keep your heart with all diligence',
Proverbs 4:23.</p>
<p>•Unequally yoked together, 'Be ye
not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath
righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with
darkness?' 2 Corinthians 6:14.A
yoke is a wooden crosspiece that is fastened over the necks of two oxen and
used for ploughing.The oxen are yoked
to be one.When unbelievers are yoked
with believers there is a conflict of interests.The believer is bound by the unbeliever. Being
unequally yoked in marriage will leave us unable to fulfil our
ministries.There is liberty when two
are yoked having one mind; to serve Christ.</p>
<p>4.Stand fast in the joy of the Lord, Philippians 4:4.Christians become bound when they are 'full
of care'.The evidence of being free is a
joyful relationship with Christ every moment of the day. </p>
<p>•Ministry must be out of joyful hearts. People who
minister joy from a platform must minister joy in their homes otherwise it is
'a performance of joy' and not 'a life of joy'. They are bound but pretend to
be free.Joy has nothing to do with
circumstances.Happiness is dependant
upon favourable happenings.Joy rejoices
in the Lord. We should examine ourselves to see if we are 'full of joy' or
'full of care'.</p>
<p>•Rejoicing in the promises of God. 'Whereby are
given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be
partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the
world through lust.'2 Peter 1:4.Our joy is in what God has promised.Whatever may happen 'And we know that all
things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called
according to his purpose.' Romans 8:28</p>
<p><span><b>Summary:</b></span></p>
<p>1.Stand in the liberty of the new creation. It is the
life of Christ dwelling in the believer. </p>
<p>2.Stand in the liberty of Christ by walking in the
Spirit.Glorify the Lord with our lives
and do not love the world. The love of the world is opposed to the love of
Christ.</p>
<p>3.Stand in the liberty of Christ by keeping in right
relationships and not become bound through friendship with the world.</p>
<p>4.Stand in the joy of the Lord.Free from the bondage of the cares of the
world by trusting in the promises of God.</p>
