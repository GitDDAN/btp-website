<p><b>Lesson Title:Agathos</b></p>
<br/>
<span>Matthew 19:16-22'And, behold, one came and said unto him, <u>Good</u>
(agathos) Master, what <u>good</u> (agathos) thing shall I do, that I may have eternal
life?And he said unto him, Why call you me <u>good</u>? there
is none good (agathos)but one, that is, God: but if you will enter
into life, keep the commandments.He
says unto him, Which? Jesus said, You
shall do no murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You
shall not bear false witness, Honour your father and your mother: and, You
shall love your neighbour as yourself.The young man says unto him, All these things
have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?Jesus said unto him, If you will be perfect, go
and sell that you have, and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in
heaven: and come and follow me.But when
the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great
possessions.'</span>
Follow after 'agathos'.
<p><b>Introduction:</b><span><b>Meaning of'Agathos'</b></span></p>
<p>A good (agathos)
heart is one that instead of working ill to a neighbour, acts beneficially
towards him.(Vines)</p>
<p>Agathos means good that acts for the benefit of others.</p>
<p><span class="GramE"><b>'Agathos'
and 'Kalos'.</b></span><b></b></p>
<p>There are two different Greek words in the
New Testament which are usually translated 'good','agathos' and 'kalos'. </p>
<p>In the parable of the sower
some seed fell on good ground.In Luke
8:8, the word for good is 'agathos' but in Luke 8:15
in describing the same ground the word translated good
is 'kalos'.</p>
<p>Both 'agathos'
and 'kalos' are translated as 'good', but there is a
difference in the meaning of these Greek words.</p>
<p>We are to follow after 'agathos'. </p>
<p>1 Thessalonians 5:15'See that none render evil for
evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good (agathos),
both among yourselves, and to all men.'</p>
<p>We are to hold fast to 'kalos'.</p>
<p>1 Thessalonians 5:21'Prove all things; hold fast
that which is good (kalos).'</p>
<p>Agathos refers to something that is good in its character or constitution
and is beneficial in its effect(Vines).</p>
<p>The character of 'Agathos'
is seen by what it does. </p>
<p>A good (agathos)
tree will produce fruit</p>
<p>Luke 8:15 'A good heart' (agathos) will give sacrificially.</p>
<p>See Lesson 5 for teaching on 'Kalos'</p>
<h3>Introductory Illustration</h3>
<p>Example of Barnabas</p>
<p>Look at the good (agathos)
heart of Barnabas in Acts 4:36-37 - he sold a large piece of land and gave to
the assembly of believers.</p>
<p>Barnabas is described as good (agathos) Acts 11:24 'A good man' (agathos) 'full of the Holy Spirit'.</p>
<p>Acts
11:22-24'Then tidings of these things came
unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth
Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch.Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of
God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would
cleave unto the Lord.For he was a good
man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and much people was added unto
the Lord.'</p>
<p><b>Main
Points:</b></p>
<h3>1. The Rich Young Ruler needed to recognise the person of Jesus.</h3>
<p>The Rich Young Ruler approached Jesus using the word 'agathos'.</p>
<p>There is
confusion over this passage.Jesus asked
the Rich Young Ruler 'Why do you call Me good, there
is none good but God'.He did not tell
the young man not to say it but only drew his attention to what he had said.</p>
<p>Jesus was the
Master Teacher and he spoke to the man with the intention of guiding him into
truth.</p>
<p><a href="/courses/languages/greek-word-studies/greekweb/deductive.html"><span class="text-primary">Deductive Reasoning</span></a></p>
<p>Jesus used deductive reasoning with the Rich Young Ruler.</p>
<p>First of all Jesus drew the man's attention
to what he had said.</p>
<p>The logic of his words could only leave one
conclusion that Jesus is God.</p>
<p>'Good (agathos)
Master'</p>
<p>'Why do you call ME good?'There is none good but God.</p>
<p>Deductive reasoning begins with a
proposition ('Only God is good')</p>
<p>Then we associate the subject with the
proposition ('Jesus is good')</p>
<p>From this we draw the conclusion ('Jesus is
God')</p>
<p>If the proposition is right the conclusion
must be right.</p>
<h3>2. The need to recognise the bankruptcy of good works.</h3>
<br/>
<p>Jesus then continued to answer the question
of the Rich Young Ruler: </p>
<p>He came to Jesus seeking to be justified by
his deeds 'what good thing must I do to inherit eternal life?'</p>
<p>No matter how good he was, his conscience
told him he wasn't good enough.This is
seen by the fact that he asked Jesus this question.</p>
<p>Jesus did not give an immediate answer as
He needed to guide Him into truth.</p>
<p>He did not just say 'follow Me'.</p>
<p>He had to remove the Rich Young Ruler's
trust in his own deeds.</p>
<p>So He leads him first by telling him to do
what he already tried to do.</p>
<p>Jesus said 'keep the commandments'.</p>
<p>In Mark's gospel it says 'defraud not' -
this was not a specific commandment but it is commandment derived from the
others - do not covet, do not steal, do not lie.</p>
<p>Notice Jesus doesn't mention the
commandments in relation to 'Love the Lord your God', but only 'Love your
neighbour as yourself'.</p>
<p>This is because the question was 'what good
(agathos) thing must I do' and Jesus was dealing with
the issue of doing good 'agathos'</p>
<p>Definition:A good (agathos)
heart is one that instead of working ill to a neighbour, acts beneficially
towards him.(Vines)</p>
<p>The rich young ruler believed he had always
done this. </p>
<p>He was using his authority as ruler, his youthful
energy, and his money for the benefit of others.Jesus loved him.</p>
<p><b>The inability of works</b></p>
<p>Jesus sought to bring the Rich Young Ruler to the place of unconditional surrender</p>
<p><b>Illustration:</b>First World War was ended by an Armistice.<b></b></p>
<p>The result was that the German people did
not know they had been defeated.</p>
<p>The Treaty of Versailles in 1919 was seen
as a betrayal</p>
<p>The result was the eventual rise of Hitler,
Nazism and WW2. </p>
<p>But learning by the mistake the allies
would only accept 'unconditional surrender' to end WW2 and instead of having a
treaty to 'make Germany pay' the Marshall Plan was formed to help rebuild
Germany. </p>
<p>The church today is weak because we try to
bring people to Christ without bringing them to the point of 'unconditional
surrender'.</p>
<p>Jesus took the Rich man down the road of
works.</p>
<p>Jesus showed him the one 'good' thing that
he should do. </p>
<p>He deals with the issue of trusting riches
and the law's requirement to 'love your neighbour as yourself' in regard to
'giving to the poor'.</p>
<p>No matter how much you give to the poor,
there will still be more poor.</p>
<p>Jesus said 'the poor you always have with you', John
12:8</p>
<p>You find this with missions</p>
<p>The more you give the more they need -
there is no end.</p>
<p>That is why missions should aim to become
indigenous.</p>
<p>This is not always possible but it should
always be the aim.See the book 'The
indigenous Church' by Melvin Hodges.</p>
<p>But in regard to the poor, how can you ever
fulfil this law 'You shall love your neighbour as yourself'?</p>
<p>The scripture says concerning the poor (our
neighbour)</p>
<p>Proverbs 21:13'Whoso stoppeth his ears at the
cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard.'</p>
<p>Jesus is answering the question 'What good (agathos) thing must I do'.</p>
<p>The rich man is following after 'agathos' 'to inherit eternal life. </p>
<p>Jesus says do this good thing - 'sell everything you have and
give it away to the poor'.</p>
<p>'Robertson
states that the Rich Young Ruler "Went away grieved." He felt that
Jesus had asked too much of him. He worshipped money more than God when put to the
test. Does Jesus demand this same test of every one? Not unless he is in the
grip of money. Different persons are in the power of different sins.One sin is enough to keep one away from
Christ.' (see Online Bible)</p>
<p>This misses the point.</p>
<p>The man's riches was not the issue.</p>
<p>The issue is 'agathos'
what good thing must I do to inherit eternal life.</p>
<p>The good thing is 'love your poor
neighbour'.</p>
<p>There are only two ways to 'love your poor
neighbour' and for your conscience to know you did all that was possible.</p>
<p>1.To give until world poverty has come to an end,or</p>
<p>2.'Give all away' so you become poor yourself.</p>
<p>No. 1 is impossible so No. 2 was the only
option.</p>
<p>The end of the road of good works is no nearer eternal life
     than at the start.</p>
<p>What good thing must I do? - Well if you
want to walk down the road of 'doing good to inherit eternal life' then this is
as far as the road can go - 'sell all your property, everything that you have
and give to the poor'.</p>
<p>It is a wonderful truth that earthly riches
can be used in this life to gain an eternal inheritance when it is given with a
good (agathos) heart filled with the love (agape) of
Christ.But giving all away is not
enough to inherit eternal life.</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 13:3 'And though I bestow all my goods to feed
the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it
profits me nothing.'</p>
<p>Riches can not bring eternal life, but
riches can stop a person inheriting eternal life.</p>
<p>He went away sorrowful because he had much
riches.He was unable to do this good
thing - but even this good thing could not have saved him.</p>
<p>Jesus was showing him how far the road of
works went - 'sell all that you have and give to the poor' - this is the 'good
thing'.</p>
<p>But from this road of spiritual bankruptcy
there was a way to inherit eternal life.Jesus says to him 'then come and follow me'.</p>
<h3>3. Follow Me:</h3>
<p>It is not by
following 'agathos' that we inherit eternal
life.It is by following Christ that we
inherit eternal life.<i></i></p>
<p>This is the message of the book of Galatians.</p>
<p>The Law was the tutor to bring us to
Christ, Galatians
3:24'Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be
justified by faith.'</p>
<p>Jesus said 'Be perfect even as your Father in heaven
is perfect.'</p>
<p>Perfection is maturity.</p>
<p>Under the law -we are like children.</p>
<p>Under the gospel - we grow towards maturity
as disciples of Christ.</p>
<p>There is none agathos except God</p>
<p>Jesus is Agathos</p>
<p>Jesus is God</p>
<p>We should follow after agathos</p>
<p>Jesus is agathos</p>
<p>Follow Jesus</p>
<p><b>Theological Question:</b> Goodness is the fruit of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Why did Jesus say 'there is none good but
God?'</p>
<p>What about the angels?</p>
<p>Are they not good?</p>
<p>The angels are 'holy' but being 'good' is
more than this.</p>
<p>Being 'good' (agathos)
is higher than the nature of angels; only God is 'good' (agathos).</p>
<p>Being good (agathos)
is having the character of God.</p>
<p>Adam and Eve were created in the image of
God - the angels were not.</p>
<p>Goodness is a 'fruit of the Spirit'.</p>
<p>Galatians 5:22 'goodness' 'agathosune' from 'agathos' </p>
<p>It is produced through the life of Christ
in the believer.</p>
<p>The Rich Young Ruler said 'what good thing
must I do?' </p>
<p>Here is the answer:Follow Christ and let His goodness live
through us by bearing the 'Fruit of the Spirit'.</p>
<p>We will be rewarded for 'agathos' -
     the works we fufil because the life of Christ
     dwells in us.2 Corinthians 5:10'For we must all appear before the
     judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his
     body, according to that he has done, whether it be good (agathos) or bad (kakos).'C.T. Studd (1860-1931) put it this way 'Only one life will soon be past, Only what's done for Christ will last'</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Jesus is 'agathos'.We must seek after Him. </p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> The Rich Young Ruler needed to recognise that Jesus is God.He recognised His character
     but failed to understand the significance that He is the Christ, the Son
     of God.</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> The Rich Young Ruler needed to recognise the bankruptcy of good works.He sought to inherit eternal life through good works but not matter how much we do we can never inherit eternal life by works.</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> The Rich Young Ruler needed to recognise that he needed to follow after Jesus.It is not by following good works that we inherit eternal life.It is by following Christ that we inherit eternal life.</p>
