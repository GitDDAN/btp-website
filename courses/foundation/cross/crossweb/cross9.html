This is a cross we must carry daily.</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>&gt; A <st1:place>W Tozer</st1:place> - Wrote the article <a href="http://www.acts17-11.com/snip_tozer_cross.html"><span class="italic text-gray-600">"The cross is a radical thing"</span>. </a> He wrote that a person who took up his cross wasn<span class="italic text-gray-600">"t coming back.<span> The person who carried the cross was dead to his or her own ambitions.</span></span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Introductory<span> Story:</span></b>Personal Testimony - <span><span>The Turnaround</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Exposition:</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">1. Taking up the cross means being turned around from selfish ambitions.<span> The disciples needed to have a turnaround experience.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>&gt; Peter was turnaround.<span class="italic text-gray-600">"And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: But I have prayed for you, that your faith fail not: and when you are converted, strengthen thy brethren."</span> (Luke 22:31-32). Peter was truly the disciple of Christ but Jesus told Peter he would be converted.The word converted in Greek is epistrepho, this word literally means to turn towards.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Why did Simon Peter need to be turned around?</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Up until this time Peter was running towards the goal of a successful ministry. Peter sought to become great through a successful ministry. Peter was competitive and ambitious. He was part of a ministry team, but it was not the love of Christ that motivated him.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The Lord allowed Peter to be sifted in order to remove the chaff of self-glory from the wheat of love for Christ. Peter regarded himself as better than all the other disciples when he said, <span class="italic text-gray-600">"Although all shall be offended, yet not I (Mark <st1:time hour="14" minute="29">14:29</st1:time>). Peter's self confidence had to be broken before he could fulfil the ministry the Lord had called him to do. He had to be turned around.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"&gt; All the disciples had seen their relationship with Jesus as an opportunity to achieve greatness."</span>And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.<span class="italic text-gray-600">" (Luke 22:24). They had very big ambitions for their ministries, and they sought to use their relationship with Jesus to gain a position where they would be highly esteemed.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>&gt; Only Judas could not be turned towards the right goal. Satan was able to destroy Judas because Judas did not love Christ. The disciples all ran towards success, but Judas followed Christ for gain. The other disciples were not like Judas, which is why it was impossible for Satan to destroy them; he could only sift them. Satan cannot do anything without God<span class="italic text-gray-600">'s permission.</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">2. Taking up the cross is necessary for discipleship.<span> A disciple of Christ is one who learns to be like Christ.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>&gt; The Greek word <span class="italic text-gray-600">"mathetes"</span> which is translated disciple means <span class="italic text-gray-600">"a learner"</span>. Disciples of Christ learn to rest in the Father<span class="italic text-gray-600">'s will. The disciples were learning Christ. They still had to learn the real nature of ministry. All of Peter's ambitions concerning a successful ministry died when Jesus was crucified. He thought everything was lost, but he was learning to be like Jesus who came not to fulfil His own ambitions, but to obey the Father<span class="italic text-gray-600">'s will.</span></span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>&gt; Jesus taught his disciples the true nature of discipleship, John 13:34-35<span> <span class="italic text-gray-600">"A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another. By this shall all <i>men</i> know that you are my disciples, if you have love one to another."</span> The disciples had to learn to take up their cross and die to their own ambitions and be willing to lay down their lives for one another. 1 John <st1:time hour="3" minute="16">3:16</st1:time><span> <span class="italic text-gray-600">"Hereby perceive we the love <i>of God</i>, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down <i>our</i> lives for the brethren."</span></span></span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">3. Taking up your cross means ministry must only be motivated by the love of Christ.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"&gt; If we are motivated by love for Christ then we will look upon others as better than ourselves. If we are motivated by personal ambitions then we will seek to use others to elevate ourselves. Paul said it was the love of Christ that held his ministry together. 2 Corinthians 5:14.<span> See also John 21 - Jesus taught Peter that ministry must be out of love for Christ.</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>&gt; The minister who has been turned around seeks not a successful ministry, but to please the Lord. Look at Peter in prison sleeping, without concern. Herod had already executed James the brother of John, and it was certain that he would put Peter to death the same way. <span class="italic text-gray-600">"Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him. And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison."</span> (Acts 12:5-6). The Lord had told Peter he would be in this position when he was old. He was not yet old, and Peter rested in the will of God. This was not a man seeking to build up his own ministry. He had no fear of death, and he had no ambitions of his own.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Summary:</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Taking up your cross means</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>1.</strong> To turn our backs to selfish ambitions and seeking only to glorify Christ. We can have selfish ambitions even when we are seeking to be disciples of Christ.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>2.</strong> To learn to be like Christ.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>3.</strong> To minister out of love for Christ.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">To seek the prize "to win Christ'.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b><a href="http://www.bibleteachingprogram.com/cfcross.html"><span>Course Index</span></a></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Back to <b><span><a href="http://www.bibleteachingprogram.com/"><span>Bible Teaching Program</span></a></span></b></p>
