<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-GB">FRASERBURGH<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">What happened at </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Yarmouth</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> was to
prove that the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Jock boarded a
train for the North and before it had reached </span><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Crewe</span></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB"> all those who were in his
compartment were led to Christ. When he arrived at </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Aberdeen</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB">, he then
transferred to the <span class="SpellE">Fraserburgh</span> train. At Maud two
fisherwomen came into the carriage and sat beside Jock. They had spent the day
selling their freshly caught haddock around the farmhouses in the country.
Baskets were strapped across their backs to carry the fish. The evangelist was
asked where he was going and what he intended to do.He replied, "I am going to <span class="SpellE">Fraserburgh</span> to preach," and told them how God had
spoken to him. "Where are you staying?" they asked him. Jock told
them that he had no idea. "Listen son, you come and stay with me,"
said one of the old fisherwomen.So
provision was made for him even before he arrived in <span class="SpellE">Fraserburgh</span>.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">When he had
settled in and had eaten, Jock decided to go for a walk. He went down to the square
in </span><st1:street><st1:address><span lang="EN-GB">Broad Street</span></st1:address></st1:street><span lang="EN-GB"> where a crowd had gathered. Standing on the steps of the drinking
fountain, he began to preach. Immediately the crowd moved around him in spite
of the cold. As the rain began to fall, the preacher asked if anyone knew where
a place was available for meetings.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"What about
the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span lang="EN-GB">Baptist</span></st1:placename><st1:placetype><span lang="EN-GB">Church</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">?" shouted <span class="GramE">someone.</span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">"I don't know
where it is," replied Jock. "We will soon take you there," <span class="GramE">came</span> the answer from the crowd.Off they went along the way, joyously singing
with the evangelist. When they arrived at the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span lang="EN-GB">Baptist</span></st1:placename><st1:placetype><span lang="EN-GB">Church</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">, the
Pastor with his elders were just leaving a specially convened meeting, where it
had been decided to send for Jock Troup to come and conduct a gospel campaign
in <span class="SpellE">Fraserburgh</span>. The secretary had a letter drafted
ready for posting, but that letter never needed to go through a letter box. God
had answered the letter before it had been sent off. To the amazement of Jock,
as the group of elders left the church, amongst them stood the man God had
shown him in the vision at </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Yarmouth</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB">. He had come face to face with the man who had prayed. The heart of
the revivalist rose to God in gratitude for leading him step by step. As he led
the singing of the old fashioned hymns, men and women began to weep their way
to the cross. Blessing flowed like a river. The tide of spiritual dearth had
turned and soon Gods flood tide would flow.</span></p>

application was made for the use of other buildings, but this was refused
because the evangelist was not an ordained minister. Meetings were then held in
the Congregational Church in Mid Street, with regular prayer taking place in
the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span lang="EN-GB">Baptist</span></st1:placename><st1:placetype><span lang="EN-GB">Church</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">. Nightly souls were under deep conviction of sin, and after weeping
their way to Christ, came to know the great experience of being "Born
again". These were days of blessing which were never to be forgotten as
long as the converts lived.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">At </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Yarmouth</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> some
notorious characters had become Christians. When they arrived home they had the
joy of not only being united with their loved ones, but in many cases were
overjoyed to find that their families had been touched by the same power of
God. These wayward sons and daughters were saved through God answering the
prayers of believing parents. As entire households made their way to the
services, no one could doubt that the same God Who had worked in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Yarmouth</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> was now
working in <span class="SpellE">Fraserburgh</span>. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">There was a spirit
of conviction everywhere.Souls were
even being saved away from the meetings. It was reported that the message boys
were whistling hymns as they delivered their errands. By now, the entire town
was in the grip of the presence of God. Throughout the last week in November
1921, open-air services were held in the </span><st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE"><span lang="EN-GB">Saltoun</span></span><span lang="EN-GB"> Square</span></st1:address></st1:street><span lang="EN-GB">. Many hundreds attended to hear the testimonies of young men and
women, <span class="GramE">then</span> Jock Troup preached the Gospel.</span><st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE"><span lang="EN-GB">Saltoun</span></span><span lang="EN-GB"> Square</span></st1:address></st1:street><span lang="EN-GB"> was the birthplace of many souls who, under deep conviction of sin,
knelt on coats provided by the preachers and converts.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The Baptist and
Congregational Churches were throwing their whole weight behind this move of
God and at the end of the day there was a marked .increase in membership as
many of the new converts attached themselves to these churches.</span></p>

<p class="body-text-larger"><strong>Scene at Fraserburgh harbour in the days of sail.</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(Picture: St. Andrews University.)</p>
<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A group of young
fishermen prided themselves in being known as the "Dirty Dozen". When
they were gloriously saved, a tremendous impact was made on the town. A report
of the scenes following some of these services said that many young people were
parading the streets calling upon the name of the Lord.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It was obvious
that God's channel was Jock Troup. This humble servant of the Lord said nothing
new about the Gospel, but it seems that he uttered the good news of salvation
with such a force and conviction that it reached the hearts of the people. Jock
was wholly yielded to the work. There was no sadness or fear in his message,
the services being characterised by joyful singing. Meetings were held every
hour of the day, with prayer sessions lasting into the night. On Sunday the
evangelist was in great demand, no wonder he became so exhausted that a doctor
told him that he would have to rest, otherwise he would kill himself.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Many prominent men
from the religious and secular world came to <span class="SpellE">Fraserburgh</span>
to witness the amazing scenes. Some criticised the work, saying it was because
of the poor fishing, or that it only appealed to simple <span class="SpellE">fisherfolk</span>.
Others declared that it was mostly emotional and would not stand. There were
those who had to admit that some supernatural power was in evidence. One man in
particular, Mr. D. P. Thompson, a student from </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span lang="EN-GB">Glasgow</span></st1:placename><st1:placetype><span lang="EN-GB">University</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">,
declared it to be a work of God.He
threw his lot in with the meetings. No doubt it was the influence of those
early days that made D. P. Thompson the man he was in later years, a prominent
evangelist with the Church of Scotland.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">On the 20th
December, Jock addressed a packed Congregational Church, stating that the work
had grown so much that the building was too small. During the week the meetings
would be held in the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span lang="EN-GB">Parish</span></st1:placename><st1:placetype><span lang="EN-GB">Church</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB"> which seated 1200.The
Church Session had kindly granted the use of their church, even declaring that
they would pay the heating bills.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Jock announced
that during the next fortnight he and Willie Bruce would be leaving <span class="SpellE">Fraserburgh</span> for an unknown destination, and that God was
leading them. "The move would be greater yet" he declared, and told
the people that the Rev. Douglas Brown of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">London</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> would be
coming to help in the meetings. He spoke to his audience in a confident manner,
"Douglas Brown is a small man, but he has both his hands on God's
Altar." The Baptist minister had been active in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Yarmouth</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB"> for he had
conducted 350 meetings in 3 months.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">As the year drew
to a close, Jock received a request to come to </span><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Dundee</span></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">. Ever sensitive to the
Master's call, he decided that he must go immediately. During a farewell
service in the Congregational Church which was filled to capacity, he heard
tributes to the work which God had done through him. Rev. W. Gilmour of the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span lang="EN-GB">Baptist</span></st1:placename><st1:placetype><span lang="EN-GB">Church</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span lang="EN-GB"> said,
"A man came to <span class="SpellE">Fraserburgh</span> whose name was Jock
Troup, and the <span class="SpellE">fisherfolks</span> would never forget by
recollection and prayer." </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Many wept tears of
joy because through his ministry they had found a purpose for living.Crowds thronged the railway station at <span class="SpellE">Fraserburgh</span> and sang as the revivalist left with his
companion. As the train moved out of the station, the huge crowd sang,
"God be with you till we meet again."What a scene, the like of which has never been witnessed, before or
since.It was the first of many visits
to <span class="SpellE">Fraserburgh</span> Jock was to make, the last being in
1953 to attend the burial service for the victims of the <span class="SpellE">Fraserburgh</span>
lifeboat <span class="GramE">disaster .</span> One of the men lost then was a
dear friend of his, a Mr. <span class="SpellE">Duthie</span>, the engineer.He had been saved in the awakening in
1921.On such a sad occasion, Jock
sang, as only he could sing, </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span lang="EN-GB">"In the sweet by and by, <o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span lang="EN-GB">We shall meet on that beautiful shore." <o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Those who were
there, including my parents, testified that it was the finest they had ever
heard the revivalist sing.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A <span class="SpellE">Fraserburgh</span> fisherman named Willie Bruce was Jock's chum, even
before Willie Bruce was converted. During the daytime they worked together, but
at night they went their separate ways. Bruce was quiet, reserved young man,
but when God saved him, this expert dancer and roller-skater became a lion for
Christ, declaring His Gospel with great boldness. At the height of the revival
in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span lang="EN-GB">Yarmouth</span></st1:place></st1:city><span lang="EN-GB">, Willie said to Jock in prophetic terms, "Jock, after this
year you are not bound for Wick this time, it's the <span class="SpellE">Broch</span>."
