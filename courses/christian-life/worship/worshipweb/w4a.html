"The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, says the LORD of hosts: and in this place will I give peace, says the LORD of hosts.<span class="italic text-gray-600">" (Haggai 2:9) </span></li> </ul> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Introductory Story:</b>Herod's <st1:city><st1:place>Temple</st1:place></st1:city> in <st1:city><st1:place>Jerusalem</st1:place></st1:city></p> <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-4" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal">Herod<span class="italic text-gray-600">'s <st1:city><st1:place>Temple</st1:place></st1:city> looked spectacular from its outward appearance.<span> But the glory of God never dwelt in the inner sanctuary of this temple.</span></span></li> </ul> <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-4" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal">For most people, there was not a lot of difference between the temple with the glory of God and the temple without the glory of God. The temple was still the heart of the nation and the centre of the Jewish religion.<span> The everyday affairs of the temple carried on exactly the same, and the people gloried in the outward appearance of the magnificent building that Herod had built. But there were some who looked for the "</span>glory of<st1:country-region><st1:place>Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region><span class="italic text-gray-600">".<span> One of these was an old man called Simeon. When Jesus was taken to the temple to be dedicated, Simeon took hold of the baby and said, &gt;<span class="italic text-gray-600">"</span>a light to lighten the Gentiles and the glory of Your people <st1:country-region><st1:place>Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>"</span> (Luke <st1:time hour="2" minute="32">2:32</st1:time>).</span></li> </ul> <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-4" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal">The glory of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region> was Jesus, but most people were content with the glory of the temple building and the activities of organised Jewish religious life.<span> It is exactly the same in the Church today. Many people in the Church have no desire for the presence of the Lord. They are satisfied with living as Christians and being respectable people in the community. They do not want to become fools for Christ, or to be worshipping witnesses to Christ. They are genuinely saved, but they have no desire for worship beyond singing some songs of worship. They are missing the highest calling of God to become worshippers.</span></li> </ul> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Exposition:</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>1.</strong> The temple is the place where the glory of God dwells.</p> <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-4" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal">Isaiah saw a place where God sits enthroned in the heavens; where the angels of God worship crying "Holy, Holy, Holy<span class="italic text-gray-600">".<span> The temple where His glory dwells.
