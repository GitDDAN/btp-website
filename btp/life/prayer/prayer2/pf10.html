When we sow bountifully then we can pray confidently for a good harvest.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">We can pray confidently concerning our daily needs when we have been generous and blessed others.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">We can pray confidently on behalf of others concerning their needs when they have been generous and blessed others.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">We can pray for blessing when we have blessed others.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">We can ask the Lord to forgive us when we have forgiven others.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Remember when a person who has new life in Christ asks for forgiveness it has nothing to do with salvation.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">It has everything to do with prayer.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">We need forgiveness to see answered prayer.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Bitterness and the works of the flesh will stop us from seeing answered prayer.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Main Points</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>1.<span> Confident prayer requires Faith + love.</span></b>1 John 3:21-23, Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.

mb-4"><b>Examples of the link between what a person has done and answered prayer in scripture</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Paul told the Philippians that the Lord would supply all their needs because they had supplied his.<span> (Philippians 4:17).</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">A person who prayed for the <st1:place><st1:placename>Philippian</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Church</st1:placetype></st1:place> could have great confidence the Lord would provide their needs because they were a giving Church.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">A Christian who does nothing to help others when they have abundance cannot expect God to meet their needs when they have financial problems.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b><strong>a)</strong> </b><b>Centurion</b> built a synagogue<span> >Luke</span> 7:4-5 And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this: For he loves our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">We speak much about the centurions faith speak the word only.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">But it is hardly ever mentioned about what he had done.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Both are important</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b><strong>b)</strong> </b><b>Dorcas</b><b> (Tabitha)</b> full of good works.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Acts <st1:time hour="9" minute="36">9:36</st1:time><span> Now</span> there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and alms deeds which she did.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Peter kneeled down and prayed (he did not presume) then he turned to Dorcas and she was raised from the dead.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b><strong>c)</strong> </b><b>Cornelius</b> he and his household were devout, generous, prayerful.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Acts 10:1-2 There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band,<span> A devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway</span>.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">God answered the prayers of Cornelius because of his character.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Prayer that reminds the Lord of what a person has done.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">When praying concerning the needs of people there is great power in reminding the Lord of His promises and then reminding the Lord of what the person has done.<b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>3.<span> Confident prayer requires Faith + knowing and asking according to the will of the Lord</span></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>the will of the Lord</b>1 John 5:14-15<span> And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he hears us: And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b><strong>a)</strong> </b><b>Elijah (1 Kings 17)</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Elijah prayed that it would not rain.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">His prayer put him into a position of great difficulty.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">He had no means of support.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The Lord used ravens to bring him meat at the brook.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">When the brook dried up, a poor widow woman was his means of provision.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Elijah needed the supernatural supply of God because he prayed according to the will of the Lord.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">If we want to see answered prayer we must also be ready to endure hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.<span> (</span>2 Timothy 2:3)</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">This is why I love preaching in prisons.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Prisoners respond to this message.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Often the people in churches are soft and enjoy the comforts of this life.<span> They want God to run around serving them and wonder why they do not see answered prayer.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b><strong>b)</strong> </b><b>Knowing the will of the Lord.</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">We know His will as we abide in Him.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">People who know the will of the Lord have an unstoppable determination.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">It will be seen in their daily life.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Anyone who has done anything great for the Lord has needed an unstoppable determination.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">It is only by knowing the will of the Lord that can give this.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">It is my experience that people who seek mans approval do not do great things.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Greatness is diligence with an unstoppable character and an unconcerned attitude.</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Confident prayer is an expression of greatness.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">It is praying in the will of the Lord with the diligence of an unstoppable character and an unconcerned attitude.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Summary</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Confidence in Prayer is not attained by faith alone.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">There are two aspects regarding confident prayer faith + obedience.</p> <p
