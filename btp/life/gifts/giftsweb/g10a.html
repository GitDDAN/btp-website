<p><strong>Lesson
Title:</strong>
Interpretation of Tongues</p>

<p><strong>Text:</strong> 'to another the interpretation of tongues:' 1 Corinthians 12:9. </p>

<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> What is the gift of the
interpretation of tongues?</p>

<p>The gift
of interpretation of tongues is given to bring understanding when the gift of
tongue is in operation in the church. </p>

<p>The word
interpretation means to interpret fully or to explain.</p>

<p>In Acts
chapter 2 the tongues were recognised by the people listening and so there was
no need for interpretation.</p>

<p>At the
beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century some people believed that the gift of
tongues would be given for evangelism.</p>

<p>Charles
Parham associated speaking in tongues with an end time move of the Spirit that
provided supernatural ability to preach in unlearnt foreign languages (<em>xenolalia</em>). </p>

<p>Attempts
were made to preach in tongues by their efforts were farcical, and they soon realised that it
was still necessary to learn the languages of those they sought to reach. </p>

<p>But
there are times when the Holy Spirit will speak to people through the operation
of tongues </p>

<p><strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>Introductory Story: </strong>Here is an
interesting account of how Christians were protected by a manifestation of the
Gift of Tongues.</p>

<p><em>Pentecostal </em><em>Mission</em><em> in </em><em>China</em><em> (1937).</em> </p>

<p>W G Hathaway tells the story of a miraculous
deliverance through the gift of tongues at the time when the Japanese invaded China in
1937.<em></em></p>

<p><em>Speaking in tongues a word of warning to the Japanese.</em><em></em></p>

<p>In their invasion of China, the
Japanese troops came to a mission station where there were a number of devout
people, some of whom were rejoicing in the Pentecostal experience. The native Christians had barricaded
themselves in their compound and soon there was a loud knocking on the gates as
one of the Japanese officers sought immediate admission, calling upon them to
open the door before they burst it in. </p>

<p>Eventually the door burst open, and in rushed the
Japanese soldiers taking hold first of one of the company of Chinese, a native
evangelist. He was about to kill him
when the man burst into an utterance of tongues in the power of the
Spirit. The soldier stopped and after a
moment or two said: Why did you not tell me there were Japanese here? He was told there were no Japanese in the
compound, but he insisted that there were Japanese, and said this man had just
told him in Japanese that if any harm were done to the compound or its
inhabitants the judgment of God would fall upon him and his fellow soldiers. </p>

<p>As a result of that incident none of the believers
in the compound were harmed and shortly afterward a revival broke out among the
Chinese in the district and many were brought to Christ.</p>

<p>W.G.Hathaway, <em>A Sound from Heaven</em> Victory Press: London,
1947, pp.49-50.<strong></strong></p>

<p><strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>Main
Points </strong></p>

<p><strong>1.
The Gift of Interpretation of Tongues in Scripture.</strong></p>

<p><strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>Why
does the Holy Spirit use tongues and interpretation of tongues?</strong></p>

<p>Speaking to people in tongues without
interpretation has no benefit to people listening.</p>

<p>Paul says that tongues
was a sign to unbelieving Israel when
they were taken into captivity by nations they did not understand. See Isaiah 28:11</p>

<p>I Corinthians 14:21 In the law it
is written, With <em>men of</em> other tongues and other lips will I speak unto
this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, says the Lord.<strong></strong></p>

<p>Paul told
the Church not to use the Gift of Tongues as a sign against unbelievers.</p>

<p>Tongues
have not been given as a sign of judgment.
</p>

<p>The gifts
are given to glorify Jesus. </p>

<p>In the
meeting this means a message in tongues must be interpreted.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong>
What about worship in tongues and singing in tongues?</p>

<p>When
believers meet together then it is wonderful when everyone worships in tongues.</p>

<p>When
there are unbelievers then common sense must be used.</p>

<p><strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>Why
is there no mention of Interpretation of tongues in the Acts of the Apostles?</strong></p>

<p>When
tongues were spoken on the Day of Pentecost the people understood without
interpretation.</p>

<p>But the
Acts of the Apostles does not tell us everything that happened when believers
met together.</p>

<p>Acts is
the story of how the New Testament Church began and how the message spread
through the ministry of Paul.</p>

<p>We would
not be aware of the gift of interpretation of tongues if Paul had not written
about it to the Corinthian Church. </p>

<p><strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>1
Corinthians 14:27</strong></p>

<p>Let one
interpret.</p>

<p>Interpret means to unfold the meaning doesnt
have to be a direct translation.</p>

<p><strong>2.
Testimonies concerning the operation of the gift.</strong></p>

<p><strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>Personal
Story: </strong>Tongues and
interpretation after preaching.<strong></strong></p>

<p>When I was at Bible College, I
sometimes preached at the Sunday evening meeting. An old lady who used to come to the meetings
would always give two messages in tongues as soon as the preaching ended. The messages were always interpreted by one
of the pastors. I do not know if this
was genuinely tongues and interpretation because it always happened, but the
interpretation (or prophecy) was uplifting and encouraging, and the messages in
tongues produced a tremendous excitement that helped to lay focus upon the
message that had just been preached. </p>

<p><strong><em></em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em></em></strong></p>

<p><strong>3.
Why is this gift necessary today?</strong></p>

<p><strong></strong></p>

<p>The gift is necessary when a message in
tongues is given in a meeting. </p>

<p>Tongues and
interpretation will produce expectation and excitement in a meeting. </p>

<p>They will place focus
on the scriptures and on the message preached.
</p>

<p>They will always
glorify the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p>God is not
boring. God is exciting. The Gifts of the Spirit are given to us to
profit because God is an exciting God.
