I was a young Christian and did not know the scriptures as well as I do now. I was not able to answer all their questions but I knew what had happened in my life. So I testified to them about how I had received the Lord Jesus Christ as my Saviour. I told them what my life had been like before and how I had become a new person in Christ. I could not quote scripture but I was able to speak from personal experience about becoming a new creation in Christ. After they heard my testimony one of them said I dont believe you and they went to the next house.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">I have spoken to Jehovahs witnesses since then but never as effectively as I did when I first came to Christ, and all I knew was that Jesus had changed my life.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The greatest evidence that Jesus is the Son of God is the evidence of knowing Him through personal experience.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Duncan Campbell who saw revival in Scotland said this:</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">"If you want to know whether the Bible is the word of God then don"t go to the theological colleges or the theologians."<span> He said "go and ask a sinner who has been saved by grace. He will tell you or she will tell you because they have tasted of the goodness of the Lord".</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">A person knows the Bible is the word of God when he or she has experienced the saving power of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Main Points:</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>1.</strong> John writes saying we know from experience.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">1 John 1:1-4<span> "</span>That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life; (For the life was manifested, and we have seen <i>it</i>, and bear witness, and show unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;) That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that you also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship <i>is</i> with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.<span class="italic text-gray-600">"</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>a)</strong> The senses.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">They were certain of what they are saying because they had experienced Him through the senses.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">We heard Him; we saw Him; we looked upon Him; we touched Him.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">John was emphasising the fact the he knew because he had experienced Him.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">If Jesus is not God then the disciples were lying.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>b)</strong> Eternal Life.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">They testified from experience that Jesus is the eternal One. He is eternal life.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Eternal life is an attribute of God.<span> It is uncreated life. John knew from experience that Jesus is the Life.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Knowing Jesus through experience is to know eternal life.<span> We can only know Him when we come to him for salvation.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">True repentance will draw us to Christ and faith in Him will save us.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>c)</strong> Joy.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The purpose for which John wrote about his experience of knowing Christ was to bring joy, that your joy may be full.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The body of Christ should always testify about a personal relationship with Jesus to draw the lost to Christ, and to bring joy to the body and to glorify the Lord.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>2.</strong> The testimony of Peter - Mount of transfiguration, Matthew 17:1ff</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Peter James and John were allowed to see a small glimpse of the glory that He left behind when He "made Himself of no reputation<span class="italic text-gray-600">" (Philippians 2:7).</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>a)</strong> They saw Him - Peter testified that they saw His glory on the Mount of Transfiguration 2 Peter 1:16<span><span> <span class="italic text-gray-600">"For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.</span><span>They could testify from experience that Jesus was the One of whom the prophets had spoken.</span></span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>They heard the Father bear testimony of the Son o<span>n the Mount of Transfiguration.</span><span>2 Peter 1:17-18<span> "</span>For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount.<span class="italic text-gray-600">"</span><span>Matthew 17:5<span> "</span>While he yet spoke, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.<span class="italic text-gray-600">"</span></span></span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>b)</strong> The glory of the cross.<span> When they saw the glory of Jesus they saw Moses and Elijah speaking with Him about His death, which He soon accomplished in Jerusalem.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The central message of the Church is the cross.<span> <span>Luke 9:29-31 And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment <i>was</i> white <i>and</i> glistering. And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias: Who appeared in glory, and spoke of his decease, which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>3.</strong> Knowing Him from personal experience.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>a)</strong> The desire of Paul was experiential knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ – that I might know Him (Philippians 3:10).</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Paul had been lifted to the third heaven and heard things he was not allowed to tell, 2 Corinthians 12:2-4.<span> Yet Paul still desired to know Christ. He desired a closer relationship. In Christ there is always more to desire in knowing Him.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>b)</strong> The glory of God will be seen in the body of Christ when we speak from the experience of knowing Him.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The experience of knowing Him will be seen in us. <span>2 Corinthians 4:6<span> For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, has shined in our hearts, to <i>give</i> the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The glory of God will shine through us.<span> We must let this light shine, Matthew 5:16.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The face of Moses shone when he saw the glory of the Lord in Horeb, Exodus 34.<span> But this experience did not last the glory faded. We are being changed into the likeness of the Son of God and the glory does not fade.</span>2 Corinthians 4:<span>18<span> "</span>But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, <i>even</i> as by the Spirit of the Lord.<span class="italic text-gray-600">"</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>c)</strong> The glory of God in our witness.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">If we speak only because it is written in scripture then we will not know the glory of God even though the words we speak are the Word of God.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The glory of God is seen through the witness of the body of Christ in the power of the Holy Spirit.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Elijah saw the glory of the Lord in the same area as Moses (Horeb), 1 Kings 19.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Elijah saw that the glory of the Lord was not in the earthquake, wind or fire, but in the still small voice (7000 who had not bowed to Baal.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">When John the Baptist came in the spirit and power of Elijah, he began his ministry by saying, <span class="italic text-gray-600">"I am a voice"</span>.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The glory of God was in the voice preparing the way of the LORD.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Summary:</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>1)</strong> The Apostles wrote out of personal experience.<span> They knew He was the eternal Son of God because they had experienced Him.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>2)</strong> Peter, James and John knew He was the eternal Son of God because they saw His glory on the mount of transfiguration.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>3)</span>The glory of God is seen when the body of Christ witnesses in the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>
