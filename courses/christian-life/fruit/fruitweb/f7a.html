He cannot deny Himself. His love cannot oppose His holiness. God cannot allow sin to be unpunished. The cross reveals the love of God in that He took our sin upon Himself so that we can be forgiven. There is no other way of salvation except through Jesus Christ,</span>John 3:16.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Exposition:</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>1.</strong> Goodness is the nature and character of God.</p> <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-4" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal">When Moses saw the glory of God he saw the Lords goodness.Exodus 33:18-19 And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory. And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy.The holy nature and character of the Lord is called "His goodness<span class="italic text-gray-600">". The Lord said to Moses "</span>I will let all my goodness pass by<span class="italic text-gray-600">".</span></li> </ul> <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-4" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal">The Rich Young Ruler called Jesus Good, Matthew 19:16-17.<span> See Deductive reasoning.</span></li> </ul> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>2.</strong> Goodness and truth.</p> <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-4" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal">The fruit of goodness will always uphold truth. Ephesians 5:9 <span class="italic text-gray-600">"For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;"</span></li> </ul> <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-4" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal">Goodness will preach the gospel even to those who do not want to hear. Paul told Timothy, <span class="italic text-gray-600">"Preach the Word be instant in season, out of season"</span>, 2 Timothy 4:2. Preaching to those who do not want to hear may appear to be unkind but when the Holy Spirit is in control then the preaching is in the best interest of the people. Don<span class="italic text-gray-600">"t be afraid to preach the gospel.</span></li> </ul> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>&gt; The Lord dealt kindly with sinners, but He appeared to speak harshly with the religious leaders in Matthew 23. His gentleness is seen in His dealings with the prostitutes, tax collectors and sinners because they knew they needed a Saviour. His goodness is seen in His dealings with the religious leaders who elevated themselves through religious means and did not know they needed a Saviour. See Luke 7:36-50.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"&gt; Goodness is associated with knowledge to admonish. This<b> </b>means teaching by warning, admonishing or exhorting. It is the Bible principle that every believer must be ready and able to teach others. Romans 15:14 "</span>And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that you also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.<span class="italic text-gray-600">"</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>3.</strong> Goodness and righteousness. The fruit of goodness will always uphold the righteousness of God. Ephesians 5:9 <span class="italic text-gray-600">"For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;"</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"&gt; Goodness can never be unrighteous or inconsistent with holiness. The Lord's goodness will always declare His righteousness.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"&gt; Goodness cannot let sin go unpunished. Whenever the Lord showed kindness, His goodness demanded repentance, Luke 19:1-10. The Lord showed kindness to Zacchaeus. The result of the Lord's kindness was repentance and restitution.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>4.</strong> Goodness and works. The fruit of goodness will produce good works - this is the eternal plan and purpose of God.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>&gt; God<span class="italic text-gray-600">'s eternal plan and purpose is that we have been created in Christ Jesus unto good works. Ephesians <st1:time hour="2" minute="10">2:10</st1:time> For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God has before ordained that we should walk in them. Good works that are not only kind and beneficial to others but also reveal the righteousness of God.</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>&gt; The goodness of the Lord is seen when He is glorified in our lives.2 Thessalonians <st1:time hour="1" minute="11">1:11</st1:time>, Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power: His goodness works in us so that we will become more and more like Jesus.<span> This is the eternal plan and purpose of His goodness His nature and character will be glorified through those that He has saved from the world.</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Conclusion:</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>1)</strong> Goodness is the nature and character of God.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>2)</strong> Goodness will declare truth without concern for the consequences. Speaking can appear to be unkind at times, but goodness will say what a person needs to hear not just what they want to hear. But we must be careful to speak in a right way under the leadership of the Holy Spirit.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>3)</strong> Goodness always acts in unity with the righteousness of God.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>4)</strong> Goodness will produce good works that glorify the Lord. We have been created in Christ Jesus to do good works that reflect the beauty of Jesus in us.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>What should the student do?</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">1) Never let the desire to be kind stop us from speaking truth.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">2) Always act in agreement with Gods righteousness and truth.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">3) Seek to glorify the Lord through good works.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b><a href="f7a.html">Lesson Outline</a></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b><a href="/courses/christian-life/fruit.html">Course Index</a></b></p>
