Melchisedek was both King and a Priest.<span> This was impossible under the Aaronic priesthood. The priests were Levites.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Jesus was not a priest after the order of Aaron. Jesus was of the kingly line of Judah.<span> He could not enter Holy Place in the temple.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">When Jesus was crucified Pilate wrote "Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews<span class="italic text-gray-600">".<span> Jesus hung on the cross as both King and Priest. He offered His life as a sacrifice for sin.</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>b)</strong> King of Righteousness.<span> His name is Righteousness. It depicts one who is inherently righteous.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Jesus Christ is the Righteous One. His name is Jehovah Tsidkenu, The Lord our righteousness. Jeremiah 23:5-6<span> <span class="italic text-gray-600">"Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth. In his days</span>Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this <i>is</i> his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS."</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Evidence of being born again of the Spirit of God is righteousness.1 John 2:29<span> <span class="italic text-gray-600">"If you know that he is righteous, you know that every one that does righteousness is born of him."</span> 1 John 3:7 <span class="italic text-gray-600">"Little children, let no man deceive you: he that does righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous."</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>c)</strong> King of Salem - The city of Melchisedek is peace.<span> This is where He rules.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Jesus is King of peace.2 Thessalonians 3:16<span> Now</span> the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord <i>be</i> with you all.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">He brings peace that reconciles; leads and keeps.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>i)</strong> Reconciling.Romans 5:1 <span class="italic text-gray-600">"<span>Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:"</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>ii)"&gt; Ruling.Colossians 3:15<span> "</span>And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also you are called in one body; and be thankful.<span class="italic text-gray-600">"</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>iii)&gt; Keeping.Philippians 4:7<span> <span class="italic text-gray-600">"And the peace of God, which passes all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus."</span></span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span><strong>2.</strong> A completed work.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">His work.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>a)</strong> Priesthood</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Caiaphas tore his clothes.Matthew 26:65<span> Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Caiaphas tore his clothes because he was angry but God had him do it because there was no need for a High Priest serving in the temple anymore.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The law stated:</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Leviticus 21:10<span> <span class="italic text-gray-600">"And <i>he that is</i> the high priest among his brethren, upon whose head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes;"</span>.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The true High Priest, the Lord Jesus Christ, is the eternal High Priest.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>b)</strong> Sacrifices</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">On the cross Jesus cried "it is finished<span class="italic text-gray-600">".John 19:30 "</span>When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.<span class="italic text-gray-600">"</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The work was finished.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The Son of God was made a curse on the cross so that we can be redeemed from the curse of the law.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Galatians 3:13<span> "</span>Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed <i>is</i> every one that hangs on a tree:<span class="italic text-gray-600">"</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>c)</strong> Temple</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Veil of the temple torn from the top to the bottom.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Matthew 27:51<span> <span class="italic text-gray-600">"And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom;
