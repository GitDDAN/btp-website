Ephesians 6:10-14, 'Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with
truth'. 
The Truth of God's Word must be fastened like
a belt to our lives.
<p><b>Details of the belt.</b></p>
<p>The Belt was an
essential part of the armour and not for decoration.</p>
<p>The sword and the
Roman dagger were suspended upon it.</p>
<p>Held
much of the armour in place.</p>
<p>Needed
to be firmly fastened.</p>
<p>Allowed
soldier to be ready for action.</p>
<p>Gave
soldier confidence in battle.</p>
<p>-      The belt is the whole gospel of Jesus Christ.It is 'the faith', Jude 3</p>
<p>-      Only the gospel of Jesus Christ is the power of God
unto salvation,</p>
<p>        Romans 1:16</p>
<h3>Introductory Story</h3>
<p>The benefits of religion may be highly
valued by those who have no interest in the truth. </p>
<p><span class="GramE"><b>The
Social Worker.</b></span><b></b></p>
<p>Some years ago we fostered two small children who
stayed with us for about 15 months.The
boy was only two years old, and had a lot of problems caused by the rejection
of not being with his natural parents.His sister was younger than him and did not appear to have the deep
rooted problems that he had.</p>
<p>We always used to
pray as a family, and we would ask the Lord to keep us safe before we drove
anywhere.So whenever we got into the
car to leave home, they expected us to pray together.</p>
<p>One day the social
worker came to our home to get them because they were going to visit their
parents.We watched as they got into
the social workers car and drove away from the house.The car had not gone far when it stopped for
one or two minutes before driving off again.I knew exactly what had happened.They would have said 'we haven't prayed, we haven't prayed'.</p>
<p>The social worker had a degree in religious
studies, but he did not have a belief in God.His concern was for the children.He appreciated the benefit of prayer to them because it gave them a
feeling of security.For this reason the
social worker was willing to stop the car and I presume some kind of a prayer
was made in the car.</p>
<p>Although the social worker
was willing to pray, truth was not important, what was important was the
benefit the children received from feeling secure through prayer.</p>
<p><b>Quote:</b>General William Booth, the founder of the
Salvation Army at the end of the nineteenth century said:</p>
<p>'I am of the
opinion that the greatest danger facing the twentieth century to be: </p>
<p>Religion without
the Holy Spirit;</p>
<p>Christianity
without Christ; </p>
<p>Forgiveness
without regeneration; </p>
<p>Morality without
God and </p>
<p>Heaven
without Hell.'</p>
<p><span class="GramE"><b>When
the benefits of religion are regarded as more important than truth.</b></span><b></b></p>
<p><b>Then religion used
to meet people's needs</b></p>
<p>The scriptures are not regarded as relevant</p>
<p><b>Only concern</b></p>
<p>Does religion help people? </p>
<p>If it can give a sense of comfort then it's held to be good</p>
<p><b>Question</b></p>
<p>What about truth?</p>
<p>Not regarded as relevant.</p>
<p><b>Main
Points:</b></p>
<h3>1. The Belt of Truth is Foundational.</h3>
<p><span> <b>(</b>1 Peter 5:9)'Whom resist stedfast in the faith,
knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in
the world.'</span></p>
<p><b><span>Stedfast</span></b><b> in the Faith(1
Peter 5:8-10)</b></p>
<p><b>Watch
-The devil
seeks to devour</b></p>
<p>1 Peter
5:8 'Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the
devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom
he may devour:'</p>
<p><b>Resist
- Stedfast in the Faith (we face the same conflicts)</b></p>
<p>1 Peter 5:9'Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions
are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.'</p>
<p><span class="GramE"><b>The Belt of Truth in which we
stand.</b></span><b></b></p>
<p>It is the Faith that we must earnestly contend
for.Jude 3, 'Beloved, when I gave all diligence
to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto
you, and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was
once delivered unto the saints.'</p>
<h3>Question</h3>
<p>What is
the faith?</p>
<p>It is the Gospel
message that Christ died for our sins, was buried and rose again.</p>
<p>(1 Corinthians 15:1-4)'Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto
you, which also you have received, and wherein you stand;By which also you are saved, if you keep in
memory what I preached unto you, unless you have believed in vain.For I delivered unto you first of all that
which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the
scriptures;And that he was buried, and
that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:'</p>
<p><b>The Faith is
'trusting Christ alone for salvation'.</b></p>
<p>The believer will always be pressured into adding
works to faith.</p>
<p><span>Salvation is through faith in Christ alone<b></b></span></p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> The thief on the cross, Luke 23:39-43.</p>
<p>The thief had no time to do any works; it was his
faith in Christ alone that brought eternal life.</p>
<p><b>The Belt of Truth
keeps us from being tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine.</b></p>
<p>Ephesians
4:14That we henceforth be no more
children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by
the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to
deceive;</p>
<p><b>Illustration:</b>Sailing
Boat</p>
<p>A sailing boat
that looses control in the wind will be tossed about in either direction.</p>
<p>Without the belt
of truth we can be taken in any direction by clever words.</p>
<p><b><span>Being stedfast in the faith at every stage of our Christian life.</span></b><b></b></p>
<p><b>NEW RECRUIT-</b> New in Christ </p>
<p><b>The Gospel</b> -
Christ died for us (1 Corinthians 15 :1-4)</p>
<p>Christ died for
our sins, was buried and rose again the third day</p>
<p><b>In which we
trusted</b> - by faith in Him (Ephesians 1:13)</p>
<p>Salvation by faith
- by grace not works</p>
<p><b>STRONG SOLDIER</b> -
Growth in Christ</p>
<p><span>Become strong
through <b>daily application of the word of God</b></span></p>
<p>Overcome the devil
through faith in the word of God</p>
<p><b>UNSHAKEABLE
SOLDIER</b> - Maturity</p>
<p><span>Close relationship
with the Father - <b>Know Him</b></span></p>
<p>Resting in His
will, trusting His guidance, and secure in His purpose.</p>
<ul>
<li>We
     are to be steadfast in the faith.This means being immoveable.1 Peter 5:9'Whom resist steadfast in the
     faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren
     that are in the world.' If the belt is not in place then
     everything is out of place and it is not possible to stand steadfast. </li>
</ul>
<h3>2. The
parts of the armour are closely associated.</h3>
<p><b>A soldier was not
ready to fight in warfare if the belt was not correctly fastened to keep the
armour in place.</b></p>
<p>If the Belt is loose the armour will make it harder
to fight.</p>
<p>The breastplate would not be held firmly to the
body of the soldier.</p>
<p><b>The Belt is
essential to keep the breastplate in place.</b></p>
<p>Being sanctified
by the truth.John 17:17,'Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth'.</p>
<p>When the Belt is rightly fastened then the
breastplate can be kept firmly in place. </p>
<p>If we do not keep the Faith then we will not stand
in His righteousness</p>
<p>Without truth there is no breastplate of
righteousness.</p>
<p>-      A person does not become righteous by being decent and good living.</p>
<p>-      Our own righteousness is not acceptable to God.</p>
<p>-      We must stand in His righteousness alone.</p>
<p><b>The belt of truth
cannot be separated from the breastplate of righteousness.</b></p>
<p><span>Righteousness and truth must always be together.<b></b>Psalm
85:11, </span>'Truth shall
spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven'<span>.<b></b></span></p>
<p>'For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and
righteousness and truth;' (Ephesians 5:9)</p>
<p>This goes against the teaching that what we believe
is not as important as how we live.We
can only live right if our lives are built on right beliefs.</p>
<p>Compare Matthew 7:24-27.</p>
<p>Righteousness without truth is self righteousness.</p>
<p>It is righteousness built upon our own works.</p>
<p>There is no righteousness outside of truth. </p>
<p>Living a good life cannot save, Ephesians 2:8-9. </p>
<p>Our works of righteousness are as filthy rags, Isaiah 64:6.</p>
<p><b>The righteousness
of Christ is held in place by the doctrine of Christ. </b></p>
<p>Who Jesus is -the eternal Son of God became Man.</p>
<p>What Jesus has done - gave Himself
a ransom for us.</p>
<p><b>3.</b><b>The
Belt must remain tightly fastened.</b><b></b></p>
<p><b>If the belt came
slack then the soldier was not ready for the battle.</b></p>
<p><b>Keeping the belt tightly fastened requires
discipleship.</b></p>
<p>2 Timothy 2:15, 'Be diligentto show yourself approved unto God, a
workman that needs not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.'</p>
<p>Remaining continually in the doctrine of Christ (2
John 1:9).</p>
<p><b>A soldier must be
taught discipline in putting the uniform on correctly.</b></p>
<p>An undisciplined soldier cannot be relied upon to
follow orders. </p>
<p>An undisciplined soldier will not be ready for
action.</p>
<p>An undisciplined soldier will put himself and his
associates in danger.</p>
<p><b>Illustration:The disciplined soldier</b></p>
<p>A soldier must take great care in putting on his or
her uniform.</p>
<p>A soldier in battle must dress differently from a
soldier on ceremony but every soldier must be just as disciplined.</p>
<p><b>In Christian warfare we must know what we believe.</b></p>
<p><b>Question:Why is it important to know what we believe?</b></p>
<p><b>The way of salvation is not negotiable.</b><b></b></p>
<p>Repentance and Faith</p>
<p>The Christian life is 'the life of Christ in
us'.</p>
<p><span>This is a living reality not a theological
discussion.<b> </b></span></p>
<p><b>If the belt is loose then we will not stand the
trial.</b><b></b></p>
<p>Consider the stability of Job in the trial.</p>
<p>He didn't understand the circumstances he was going
but his faith stod firm on truth. </p>
<p>'For I know that my redeemer lives, and that he
shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall
I see God' Job 19:25-26. </p>
<p><b>Keeping the belt tight means being diligent to
uphold the Truth,</b><b></b></p>
<p>'Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto
you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and
exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once
delivered unto the saints'(Jude
3).</p>
<p>Truth can be divisive,
but unity can only be built upon the word of God.</p>
<p><span class="GramE"><b>The
High Priestly prayer of Jesus (John 17).</b></span><b></b></p>
<p>The prayer of John 17:11 'that they may be one' </p>
<p>must be taken in the
context of John 17:14'I have given them
Your word'.</p>
<p><b>CHURCH HISTORY</b></p>
<p><b>Story:</b><b> 'I am captive to the Word of God' - Luther at </b><b>Worms</b><b> (1521)</b></p>
<p>When Martin Luther (1483-1546) was asked to
denounce his writings at Worms in
1521, he thought it would probably cost him his life but he boldly declared
that he was 'captive to the Word of God'.</p>
<p>History has described his stand with the words
'Here I stand, I can do no other, God help me'.</p>
<p>Scripture is the final authority of the church and
scripture can only be understood when it is read in context.</p>
<p><b>Keeping the belt tight -The</b><b> Creeds</b></p>
<p><b>The Creeds were designed to clearly define the
truth against error. </b></p>
<p><b>The Apostle's Creed (2nd century) - a clear
presentation of the Faith</b></p>
<p>'I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of
heaven and earth.   </p>
<p>And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord; who was
conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius
Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried; he descended into hell; the third day
he rose again from the dead; he ascended into heaven, and sitteth
on the right hand of God the Father Almighty, from thence he shall come to
judge the quick and the dead.</p>
<p>I believe in the Holy Ghost; the holy catholic Church; the communion of saints; the forgiveness of
sins; the resurrection of the body; and the life everlasting. Amen.'</p>
<p><b>The Nicene Creed (325)</b></p>
<p><b>A clear affirmation of the deity of Christ</b></p>
<p>'We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker
of all things visible and invisible.</p>
<p>And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
begotten of the Father, only begotten - that is, of the substance with the
Father; by Whom all things were made, both in heaven and in earth, Who for us
men and for our salvation came down, and was incarnate, and was made man;
suffered and rose the third day; ascended into the heavens; and will come again
to judge the quick and the dead.</p>
<p>And in the Holy Ghost.'</p>
<p><b>Church of England
has 39 Articles,</b></p>
<p>The Sixth Article upholds the authority of
scripture.</p>
<p><span>Article VI: Of the sufficiency of the Holy
Scripture for Salvation - <i>'Holy Scripture
contains all things necessary to salvation: so that whatsoever is not read therein,
nor may be proved thereby, is not to be required of any man, that it should be
believed as an article of the faith, or be thought requisite or necessary to
salvation.'</i></span></p>
<p>Scripture is the final authority of the church and
scripture can be understood by anyone who is willing to read it in context.</p>
<h3>4. Wearing the belt of truth means to take the
scripture as a whole.</h3>
<p><b>The Belt of Truth
refers to the whole counsel of God.</b></p>
<p>Making known the whole counsel of God.'For I
have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel
of God.' (Acts 20:27) </p>
<p>Paul did not just
preach nice messages.</p>
<p>He preached 'the
whole counsel of God'.</p>
<p>The whole will of
God.</p>
<p>We are to tell the
whole gospel not just the parts that are pleasing to people.</p>
<p><span class="GramE"><b>Comparison
between the Belt and the Sword.</b></span><b></b></p>
<p>The Belt provides a place to keep the sword.</p>
<p>Wearing the belt of truth means to take the
scripture as a whole.</p>
<p>The sword of the Spirit is taken from the belt
because scripture must be understood within the context of scripture.</p>
<p>Scripture is not for private interpretation.</p>
<p>We understand scripture in the light of
scripture.It is not just what the Bible
says but it is what the Bible also says.</p>
<p>We must rightly divide the word of truth.2 Timothy 2:15, 'Study to show thyself approved
unto God, a workman that needs not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of
truth'.</p>
<p>It is not enough to use a verse of scripture - what
does the Bible say.</p>
<p>The cults use particular scriptures but they do not
'contend for the Faith'. </p>
<p>It is good to finish by reminding ourselves once again of the words of
William Booth at the end of the 19th century. </p>
<p>'I am of the
opinion that the greatest danger facing the twentieth century to be: </p>
<p>Religion without
the Holy Spirit;</p>
<p>Christianity
without Christ; </p>
<p>Forgiveness
without regeneration; </p>
<p>Morality without
God and </p>
<p>Heaven
without Hell.'</p>
<p>These words apply even more to the 21st century.<b></b></p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><strong>1)</strong> The
belt of truth is foundational.The belt
of truth is the Faith in which we stand.We are to be stedfast in the faith (1 Peter
5:8-10).Standing on the firm foundation
of our faith.</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> The
parts of the armour are closely associated together.The belt of truth holds the breastplate of
righteousness in place.There is no
righteousness outside of truth. </p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> The
belt must be kept tight.We must hold
firm to the truth of God's word.</p>
<p><strong>4)</strong> The belt of truth is the whole counsel of God (Acts
20:27).Truth cannot be divided into segments
depending on whether they are pleasing to people.We must always declare the truth.</p>
<p><strong>5)</strong> The sword of the Spirit must be taken from
the belt.We must rightly divide the
scripture.</p>
<p><b>What should the student do?</b></p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> Study to know what we believe</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> Let the truth abide in our hearts and minds</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> Rightly divide the scriptures.</p>
<p><strong>4)</strong> Stand for the truth of God's Word.</p>
<p><strong>5)</strong> Let our lives be 'captive to the word of God'</p>
