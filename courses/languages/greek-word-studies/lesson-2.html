<p><b>Greek Word Studies </b></p>
<p><span><a href="/courses/languages/greek-word-studies/greekweb/article.html"><span class="text-primary">Notes on John 1:1 'the
definite article'</span></a></span></p>
<p><b>Theme: </b>Relationship with
the One who is the 'Logos of God '.</p>
<p><b>Introduction:</b><span> <b>Meaning of the Word 'Logos '</b></span></p>
<p>Logos in the New
Testament means 'the expressed will or mind of God '.</p>
<p><i>Logos</i> was a
word commonly used in Greek that referred to a message that was spoken.</p>
<p>The scriptures are
the revelation of the expressed will or mind of God and its fulfilment in
history. </p>
<p>It is God 's
message to mankind.</p>
<p><b>The 'Logos '
personified - The Lord Jesus Christ is the 'Logos of God ' </b></p>
<p><span>John 's gospel
calls Jesus 'the <i>logos</i> ' who has been from the beginning (a time beyond
which you cannot go). </span>John
1:1</p>
<p>The eternal Son of
God is 'the Word of God '.</p>
<p>By this John was
saying that Jesus is the revelation of 'the expressed will and mind of God '.</p>
<p>The eternal plan
and purpose of God for mankind can be seen in the person of the Lord Jesus
Christ.</p>
<p>This is expressed
at the beginning of the epistle to the Hebrews. </p>
<p> 'God, who at
sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past
unto the fathers by the prophets, Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his
Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the
worlds; Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his
person, and upholding all things by the word (rhema)
of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right
hand of the Majesty on high; ' (Hebrews
1:1-3)</p>
<p>The eternal plan
of salvation has been fulfilled through the finished work of the Lord Jesus
Christ.</p>
<p> 'Now of the
things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an
high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the
heavens; '
(Hebrews 8:1)</p>
<p>This is the
expressed will or mind of God. </p>
<p>The fulfilment of
the eternal plan and purpose of God in the lives of individuals is still taking
place.</p>
<p>But the revelation
of God 's eternal plan and purpose has been fulfilled in Jesus Christ, and is revealed
to us in the New Testament scriptures. </p>
<p>There is no new
revelation  - it is a finished work. </p>
<p>But knowing the
scriptures is not enough.</p>
<p>We need to know Jesus
Christ, the 'Logos of God ' in personal relationship.</p>
<p>John 1:1 shows us that the Logos is a person
not a doctrine.</p>
<p>We are to walk in relationship with the Logos  -
the Lord Jesus Christ. </p>
<p>Christianity is mankind being brought back into
relationship with God through Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><b>Introductory
illustration: </b>A living experience not a doctrinal dispute.</p>
<p>When I was a young preacher I was very eager to stand for truth and I associated truth with purity of doctrine. I was aware that some churches and preachers disregarded the fundamental doctrines of the faith in order to avoid causing divisions among churches. I was very much opposed to this and found myself in conflict with other Christians who were more concerned about showing love and keeping friendly relationships than they were about truth and holiness. Although their disregard for the fundamental doctrines of the faith was not good, I was also wrong in allowing myself to be drawn away from the reality of new life in Christ into contention.</p>
<p>This had two main results:</p>
<p>1) It brought
me into a negative unity with those who were against what I was against  - this
unity soon changed into conflict because these people were against many things
I was not against.  Paul was aware of
this danger when he wrote to the Galatians 'But if ye bite and
devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another. '
(Galatians 5:15)</p>
<p>2) My actions
were not motivated by 'agape love '. My approach was aggressive and not conciliatory. I was making a point but it was not productive.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> </p>
<p>Jesus ministered among the ordinary people.</p>
<p>Doctrinal arguments would have hindered His
ministry.</p>
<p>The religious leaders always sought to have a
doctrinal argument with Him.  </p>
<p>But He would never do it.</p>
<p>He answered them by saying </p>
<p> 'show me a coin' (Mark 12:14)</p>
<p> 'have you not read '
(Mark 12:18-27)</p>
<p> 'he that is without sin
cast the first stone ' (John 8:3-11)</p>
<p>Even when the Samaritan woman sought to argue over
religion, Jesus moved her thinking from religious argument to relationship. (John
4:20-24)</p>
<p> '...salvation is of
the Jews. But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers shall
worship the Father in spirit and in truth:'</p>
<p>Jesus did not get into argumentative discussions over
doctrine. </p>
<p>He warned His disciples to beware of the
leaven of the Pharisees. (Matthew 16:6-12)</p>
<p>He spoke strongly to the religious leaders. (Matthew 23:13-33)</p>
<p>When He taught in the templeHe showed the common people the error of
the teaching of the scribes. (Mark 12:35-41)</p>
<p>The result was 'the common people heard Him
gladly '. (Mark 12:37)</p>
<p>Jesus did not come to win an argument, He came to
 'seek and to save that which was lost '. (Luke
19:10)</p>
<p>Christians are not called to fight over doctrines
but to stand firmly upon the Rock, Christ Jesus, walking in relationship with
the eternal Son of God, 'the Logos of God'.</p>
<p><b>Main
Points:</b></p>
<h3>1. The word (logos) produces new life</h3>
<p>, 1
Peter 1:23 'Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word
(logos) of God, which lives and abides for ever.'</p>
<p>The logos is incorruptible seed that produces
eternal life.</p>
<p><b>The logos is seed</b>, Matthew 13:23a 'But he that received seed into
     the good ground is he that hears the word, and understands it;...'
</p>
<p>The sower is sent to sow the seed</p>
<p>When the believers were scattered following the persecution of Saul they
went everywhere preaching the word (logos) Acts 8:4, 'Therefore they that were scattered abroad
went every where preaching the word. ' Preaching (euangelizo)
means spreading good news. They went
everywhere telling people about Jesus.</p>
<p>Then Philip came to Samaria and preached
Christ Acts 8:5 'Then
Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached
Christ unto them. ' Preaching (kerusso) means
to proclaim. Philip preached Christ to
the Samaritians.</p>
<p>It was the same message. The
believers spread the good news of the word *logos '; Philip preached Christ 'the
logos'.</p>
<p>The early church did not preach adherence to a new doctrine; they
preached the person of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><span bold=""> 'Salvation in Jesus Christ alone ' is doctrine, but it is not the doctrine
that saves; the doctrine must always lead us to the person 'the Lord Jesus
Christ '. It is Christ and Christ alone
who saves.</span></p>
<p>Salvation is being brought into a new relationship with Christ.</p>
<p><b>The
     logos will produce fruit, Matthew</b>
     13:23b  '...which also bears fruit,
     and brings forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.'<b></b></p>
<p>The fruit produced by the logos is the inward fruit of new life. It is the fruit of the Spirit.</p>
<p>Fervent love towards one another is the fruit of the word 'logos'. </p>
<p>1 Peter 2:22 'Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth
through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one
another with a pure heart fervently: '</p>
<p>Defending doctrines produce strife.</p>
<p>It is not a particular doctrine that we preach, it is Christ 'the logos '.</p>
<p>The 'logos ' will produce the fruit of the Spirit 'love ' in the believer.</p>
<p>When we are born again of the incorruptible seed of the 'logos ', we will
become like the One who is the Word of God, 'Logos '.</p>
<h3>2. The logos must dwell in the
believer,</h3>
<p> Colossians 3:16 'Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and
admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with
grace in your hearts to the Lord.'<b></b></p>
<p><b>The word (logos) of Christ indwelling
     the believer</b></p>
<p>The 'logos ' indwelling the believer means being led and totally under the
influence of the 'logos of Christ '.</p>
<p>The way to do this is by teaching, admonishing and singing. Another scripture refers to speaking to
yourself in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs. (Ephesians 5:19).</p>
<p>The heart and the mind must be filled with the scriptures.</p>
<p>Believers need to meet together for the purpose of teaching, admonishing
and singing so that the 'logos of Christ ' will be in the heart and the mind.</p>
<p>Hebrews 10:25, 'Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as
the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye
see the day approaching. '</p>
<p>This does not mean coming together to hear the latest 3 point sermon but
to come together to build one another up in the word of Christ.</p>
<p>Singing should always be the 'word of Christ ' not some sentimental song
that mentions love or God but has no scriptural basis.</p>
<p><b>The word <i>(logos)</i> sanctifies, </b>John 17:17
     'Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word (logos)
     is truth. '
</p><p>The
 'logos ' is the whole revealed word of God.</p>
<p>It is
the 'logos ' that sanctifies us (sets us apart).</p>
<p>This
does not mean that we isolate ourselves from the world because of the 'logos '.</p>
<p>Isolation
from sin means we are 'in the world ', but not 'of the world '.</p>
<p>We have
been set apart unto God and we are to bring the 'logos ' to the people.</p>
<p><span>Paul
told Timothy to 'preach the <i>logos</i> ' (2
Timothy 4:2) meaning the whole revealed word.</span></p>
<p>Not just
a theme that people like to hear but the whole gospel.</p>
<p>He then
told Timothy that people would have itching ears wanting only to listen to
teachers with pleasing messages. (2 Timothy 4:3)</p>
<p>They
would be turned away from truth to fables (fictional stories). (2 Timothy 4:4)</p>
<p><b><span>3. The '<i>Logos '</i>
is to be reverenced. </span></b><span> 'For the word (logos) of God <i>is</i> quick, and powerful, and
sharper than any two edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul
and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and <i>is</i> a discerner of the
thoughts and intents of the heart. '</span> (Hebrews 4:12)<b></b></p>
<p><b>The word of God is not a word to be discussed but living and powerful.</b></p>
<p>The word has life in Himself.</p>
<p>The word is as a two edged sword that cuts into the
very heart of man so that even the inseparable can be torn apart.</p>
<p>He is able to know the thoughts and intentions of
the heart.</p>
<p><b>The word of God is a person.</b></p>
<p>In the verses that follow Hebrews 4:12 we see that
the writer is speaking about a person. Hebrews 4:13-14, 'Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but
all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to
do. Seeing then that we have a great
high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold
fast our profession.'</p>
<p>When we understand that Jesus is the Word of God then we recognise that we can only be His disciples if we love and obey His word. (John 8:31).</p>
<p>But we can come boldly into the presence of God because the One who is the eternal Word of God represents us. He is our High Priest. The Word does not bring us into the bondage of the law but into the freedom of being sons and daughters of the living God. He became like us so that we can come boldly into the Father's presence.</p>
<p>Hebrews 4:15-16, 'For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.'</p>
<p><b>Revelation of Jesus</b></p>
<p>When John had a revelation of Jesus He saw Him in
the midst of the Churches: </p>
<p>Revelation 1:13-18, 'And in the midst of the
seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to
the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden
girdle. His head and his hairs were
white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire; And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they
burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters. And he had in his right hand seven stars: and
out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his
countenance was as the sun shineth in his
strength. And when I saw him, I fell at
his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not;
I am the first and the last: I am he
that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive
for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.'</p>
<br/>
<ol>
<p><b>1) Saviour</b></p>
<p>Garment to the foot (garment of righteousness)</p>
<p>Golden girdle (High Priest)</p>
<p><b>2) Judge</b></p>
<p>Head and hair were white (discerning judge)</p>
<p>Eyes of fire (penetrating into the heart)</p>
<p>Feet as fine fiery brass (trampling on His enemies)</p>
<p><b>3) Building His church</b></p>
<p>Voice as many waters (river of life)</p>
<p>In His right hand seven stars (His messengers)</p>
<p>Out of His mouth a two edged sword (His word)</p>
<p><b>4) King of kings and Lord of lords</b></p>
<p>His face like the sun shining (His glory)</p>
</ol>
<br/>
<p>This is an outline of the book of Revelation.</p>
<p>When John saw Him he fell as a dead man.</p>
<p>The Lord told Him not to fear  - He is our High
Priest.</p>
<p>Jesus is the Word of God (Logos) who will judge the earth in
righteousness.</p>
<p>But for all who trust in Him, the word of God (Logos) is our Saviour and Provider.</p>
<p>We can come boldly into the presence of the Father and find grace,
because of what Jesus has done for us</p>
<p>In Revelation 19, John saw Him as the conquering King on a white horse.</p>
<p>Revelation 19:13 'And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.'</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The Word of God, the Logos, is the revealed will of God, 'Logos,</p>
<p>The revealed will of God is the person of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>He is the 'Logos of God ' </p>
<p>1. The Word of God (Logos)
produces new life in us.</p>
<p>2. The
Word of God (Logos) must dwell in our hearts and minds.</p>
<p>3. The Word
of God (Logos) is to be reverenced. He
is King of Kings and Lord of Lords and will destroy His enemies but to those
who believe He is our High Priest. </p>
