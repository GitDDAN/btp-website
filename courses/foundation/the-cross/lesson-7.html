It refers to one who stands as guarantee on behalf of another. It is a person who is willing to pay someone<span class="italic text-gray-600">'s debt if they are unable to pay it themselves.</span></span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">A mediator must represent two parties in order to bring them together.<span> In the case of salvation only One could mediate who was both truly God and also truly man.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">If He is not both God and man then He could only be a mediator in the sense of carrying a message.<span> God would still need to find a way of reconciliation without denying His own holiness. A guarantor stands surety for another. The Lord Jesus is the surety of our eternal inheritance.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Christ alone is the Mediator.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The way of salvation:</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>&gt; Recognising that I am a sinner, and that I<b> </b>can do nothing to save myself.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"&gt; Recognise that Jesus Christ alone can save, and call upon Him for salvation.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Introductory Story: </b><span>What will I be trusting in when I enter eternity?</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">I worked for one and a half years at a bakers in the <st1:place>Faroe Islands</st1:place>.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">When I walked to work early in the morning, I was often reminded of the scripture "His mercies they are new every morning<span class="italic text-gray-600">".</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">One day as I walked to work, I thought "what will I be trusting in when I enter eternity?<span class="italic text-gray-600">"</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">That morning I answered the question once and for all in my heart, it is "Christ and Christ alone<span class="italic text-gray-600">".</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">I will not even be trusting in how much I loved Christ.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">There is an eternal reward to be won according to the extent of my love for Christ, but my salvation is entirely through His love for me.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">I am trusting one hundred per cent in what the Lord Jesus Christ has done for me.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">My sin has already been judged because Jesus took my sin upon Himself on the cross.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Now I am free from condemnation, and I am free to be holy.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b></b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><b>Main Points:</b></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>1.</strong> He is both God and Man and able to stand in the gap.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"&gt; The reason why a Mediator is needed - the wrath of God upon sin.<span> The wrath of God - sin must be punished</span>(Exodus 34:7).</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The love of God - He delights in mercy (Micah <st1:time hour="7" minute="18">7:18</st1:time>).</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Ezekiel prophesied how the Lord sought for one to stand in the gap.<span> When He saw there was none then His wrath was poured out.</span>Ezekiel 22:30-31<span> "</span>And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none. <span>Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed upon their heads, says the Lord GOD.<span class="italic text-gray-600">"</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>&gt; To be a mediator a person must be able to represent both parties.<span> In the context of salvation it is necessary for a mediator to be able to reconcile man with God. This is not mediating in the sense of speaking on behalf of someone but it means being able to lift mankind from the place of alienation to the place of reconciliation. In being a mediator between God and mankind, Jesus, the eternal Son of God had to become a man.</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"&gt; He is able to reconcile us to God because of who He is.<span> He had to be the ladder that reaches from God to man. An angel could not be a mediator between God and man because no matter how holy they are they are not equal with God.</span></span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Jesus is God - reaches to God</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">He became Man - reaches to man</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>2.</strong> He is the go between who brings peace between man and God (Romans 5:1).<span> He is able to bring peace because of what He has done.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"&gt; He is worshipped in heaven because He is the sinless Son of God.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">No one else was worthy.</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Revelation 5:9a<span> "</span>And they sung a new song, saying, You art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for you were slain,<span class="italic text-gray-600">"</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>&gt; He is worshipped in heaven because He was slain for us.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">What He has done - The sinless Son of God became sin on the cross for us, 2 Corinthians 5:21</p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Revelation 5:9b <span class="italic text-gray-600">"and have redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;"</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><span>"&gt; He is our peace (Ephesians <st1:time hour="2" minute="14">2:14</st1:time>). We have peace with God not because of who we are or what we have done but because of what the eternal Son of God has done for us through the cross.</span></p> <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>3.</strong> He is the guarantor of the New Covenant - Jesus is the Mediator of the New Covenant.
