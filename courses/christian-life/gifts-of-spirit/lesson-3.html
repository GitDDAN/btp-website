The Gifts of the Spirit (10 Lessons)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lesson

<p><strong>Lesson
Title:</strong> A Word of Knowledge </p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Text:</strong> to another the word of knowledge. 1
Corinthians 12:8</p>
<p><strong>Introduction: </strong>What is a Word of
Knowledge? </p>
<p>A Word of Knowledge is a supernatural
revelation of facts concerning a person, place, or thing.</p>
<p>It is a word that relates to something that
has happened or is happening at that moment.</p>
<p>In contrast a Word of Wisdom relates to
something in the future.</p>
<p>The Word of Knowledge will warn; guide;
inform; and encourage </p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Introductory Illustration:</strong></p>
<p>A Word of Knowledge is able to provide
information regarding something or someone that is lost.</p>
<p>A Word of Knowledge is able to reveal the
whereabouts of something that is lost or provide information regarding how to
do something.</p>
<p>The gift operates as the Spirit wills.</p>
<p>We can ask for a Word of Knowledge when we
need to know the whereabouts of someone or something.</p>
<p>Lost keys</p>
<p>Lost person</p>
<p>We can ask for a Word of Knowledge
regarding why something has happened.</p>
<p>Why something has stopped working.</p>
<p>Experts charge large amounts of money to
provide information regarding why something has happened. </p>
<p>Knowledge can provide the information
needed so that something can be fixed.</p>
<p><strong>Main
Points:</strong></p>
<p><!--[if !supportLists]--><strong>1.     
</strong><!--[endif]--><strong>A Word of Knowledge in Scripture</strong></p>
<p><strong>Example
in the Gospels</strong></p>
<p><!--[if !supportLists]-->       
<!--[endif]--><strong>Breaking barriers.</strong></p>
<p>The conversation between Jesus and the Woman of Samaria. (John
4:7-26).</p>
<p> Gender
 man speaking to a woman </p>
<p> Racial
- barrier between Samaritans and the Jews</p>
<p> Religious
 worship on Gerizim or in Jerusalem <strong></strong></p>
<p>Jesus was able to break through the barriers
she put up by a Word of Knowledge concerning her personal life. John
4:17-18 <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Example
in the Acts of the Apostles </strong></p>
<p><!--[if !supportLists]-->       
<!--[endif]--><strong>Revealing lies </strong>The hypocrisy of Ananias
and Sapphira.
Acts 5:1-11.</p>
<p>A Word of Wisdom enabled Peter to reveal the
secret plan made by Ananias and Sapphira.</p>
<p>Without this revelation the Holy Spirit would
have been hindered. </p>
<p>The Word of Knowledge prevented Ananias and Sapphira from
building a barrier of hypocrisy in the Church.</p>
<p>The Word of Knowledge worked alongside other
gifts. Peters declaration that Sapphira would die like her husband was a Word of Wisdom. </p>
<p>The death of Ananias
and Sapphira was a manifestation of the power of the
Holy Spirit by the Working of Miracles</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><!--[if !supportLists]-->       
<!--[endif]--><strong>Revealing a location </strong>Ananias was sent to
Paul in Damascus. Acts 9:11,12.</p>
<p>The Word of Knowledge was given to Ananias concerning where Paul was located 
He is at the Street called Straight.
</p>
<p>Acts 9:11.</p>
<p>This was a
revelation of what was happening at the time a Word of Knowledge.</p>
<p>Ananias received revelation
concerning Pauls future ministry a Word of Wisdom.</p>
<p><!--[if !supportLists]-->       
<!--[endif]--><strong>Revealing visitors. </strong>The Holy Spirit revealed to Peter that people
were coming to see him. "The Spirit said unto him, Behold, three
men seek thee" (Acts 10,19).<strong></strong></p>
<p>Peter had no reservations concerning
receiving the Gentiles because God had spoken by a Word of Knowledge.</p>
<p>The Word of Knowledge gave Peter confidence
to receive Gentile visitors and to go with them to the house of Cornelius.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Example in the Old Testament:</strong></p>
<p><!--[if !supportLists]-->       
<!--[endif]--><strong>Revealing the whereabouts of
the King and his intentions </strong>"Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel ... he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone to possess it". <strong></strong>(1 Kings 21:18)<strong></strong></p>
<p>Elijah received
a Word of Knowledge concerning the King.
<strong></strong></p>
<p>He was in the
vineyard of Naboth.</p>
<p>He had gone
there to possess it.</p>
<p>The Word of knowledge in scripture empowers
the church to act with confidence.</p>
<p>It is like radar revealing what is
happening.</p>
<p><!--[if !supportLists]--><strong>2.     
</strong><!--[endif]--><strong>Testimonies of a Word of
Knowledge </strong></p>
<p><strong>Church
History: </strong>The
history of missions: William Carey used
the motto: Expect Great things from
God; attempt great things for God </p>
<p>It is my belief that it is only possible to
achieve great things for God in the power of the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p>We can achieve no great thing without the
manifestations of the Holy Spirit because the weapons of our warfare are not
carnal (2 Corinthians 10:4). </p>
<p>This means that the history of missions
must reveal the operation of the gifts and manifestations of the Spirit. </p>
<p>The Holiness movement in the 19<sup>th</sup>
century and the Pentecostal movement in the 20<sup>th</sup> century put
emphasis upon the gifts that are highly visible speaking in tongues and gifts
of healings. But the manifestations of
the Spirit appear throughout Church history.
The Word of Knowledge and the Word of Wisdom are often unseen witnesses
leading and guiding the Church. </p>
<p><strong>Personal
testimony: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Prayer: </strong>I had heard some
news that required a lot of prayer. I
decided to go for a prayer walk to pray about this urgent need. Just before I left home somebody called me
and asked me to pray for someone who had had an accident but it was not known
how serious. As I prayed for the urgent
need then I turned my attention to pray for the person who had had an accident. The thought came into my mind the person is
OK theres no need to pray. I then
continued praying for the person with the urgent need and forgot all about the
other request. The next morning I
received a call confirming what I already knew.</p>
<p>A Word of Knowledge meant I did not spend
time praying unnecessarily but gave all my attention to the urgent need. </p>
<p><!--[if !supportLists]--><strong>3.     
</strong><!--[endif]--><strong>Why is the Word of Knowledge necessary today?</strong></p>
<p>The Word
of Knowledge is necessary today for the same reasons that the Word of Knowledge
was necessary in the Book of Acts.</p>
<p><strong>a)
A Word of Knowledge gives warning to the body of Christ so that the
church is not deceived.</strong></p>
<p>The hypocrisy of Ananias
and Sapphira could only be known by a Word of
Knowledge (Acts 5:1-11)</p>
<p>A Word of Knowledge will protect the church
from deception by revealing the actions of those who oppose the moving of the
Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><!--[if !supportLists]-->a)     
<!--[endif]-->Liars</p>
<p><!--[if !supportLists]-->b)     
<!--[endif]-->Hypocrites</p>
<p><!--[if !supportLists]-->c)      
<!--[endif]-->False teachers</p>
<p>It is necessary to be able to avoid those who
seek to destroy the body of Christ. </p>
<p>We may have a witness that someone is led by
a wrong spirit because we can feel the presence of something evil. </p>
<p>But a Word of Knowledge will provide more
specific information.</p>
<p><strong>Personal
Testimony:</strong> A Word of Knowledge is able to keep the
Church from false prophets. Often these
people have money and are quickly accepted in places where leaders have
financial needs. But they cause immense
damage as they are promoters of self and not ambassadors for Christ.</p>
<p><strong>b) A Word of Knowledge will reveal the
whereabouts of people and things.</strong></p>
<p>Barnabas went to Tarsus to find Saul, Acts 11:25-26. It is not known what motivated Barnabas or
how he found Saul but it is very probable that the Word of Knowledge was
leading Barnabas. What would have happened
if Barnabas had not gone? The entire
character of the New Testament would be different. The Lord had a great purpose in leading
Barnabas to Tarsus because the Holy Spirit has revealed the message of the gospel through
the epistles of Paul.</p>
<p>A Word of Knowledge is still necessary to
provide guidance.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is only the Holy Spirit who
knows the right person for a particular task - and He can reveal His will to us
through a Word of Knowledge.</p>
<p>Often we can panic because we cannot find
something. The Holy Spirit is able to
show us where to look by bringing a particular place into our mind.</p>
<p>c) A Word of Knowledge will reveal why
something has or has not happened.</p>
<p>Sometimes we need to know the cause of a
problem.</p>
<p>Sickness may be caused by a wrong diet. A Word of Knowledge can reveal the problem.</p>
<p>d) A Word of Knowledge will break down
barriers in witnessing to people. </p>
<p>In the same way as Jesus broke down the
barriers put up by the Samaritan woman (John 4:17-18)</p>
<p>A Word of Knowledge will reveal something
that will break through all arguments and discussions.</p>
<p>Sometimes a Word of Knowledge will work with
other gifts. For instance it may be
shown by a Word of Knowledge that a person has a particular problem. Gifts of healings may then come into
operation and bring healing to the person.</p>
<p>The message of the gospel will be received
because the person has experienced the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>e) A Word of Knowledge will provide
information concerning specific issues for prayer.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit sometimes gives a Word of
Knowledge to pray for a particular person.
This can happen at any time.
Sometimes the Lord has woken a person up in the night to pray for
someone on the other side of the world.</p>
<p>Later it has become known that the person was
in great trouble at that particular time.</p>
<p>There are times when we are not aware of
danger but the Holy Spirit is able to keep us.</p>
<p>So we can have great boldness to do the will
of the Lord even in dangerous areas.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>1) A Word of Knowledge is a word given
concerning something relating to the present or the past.</p>
<p>2) Word of Knowledge is given for guidance; to
warn of current danger, and to break down barriers.</p>
<p>3) We should always be ready for the Holy
Spirit to lead us through a Word of Wisdom. </p>
